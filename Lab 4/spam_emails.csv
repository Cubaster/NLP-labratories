That's true. I used to say and think that ... back around 1992 when I started to use DEC Alpha machines. But now that 2GB is about as little RAM as you can get in a new machine, the push to move to 64bit is very real.

spam,"Strictly Private.Gooday, With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party, Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001. When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, ! En! gland for 9years now. I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my master's money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being. Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you. Yours sincerely, Donald Phiri. --DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam-- ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-Sightings mailing list Spamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings "

No need to SHOUT. I read all the messages in the same manner. ""The specs are open""... o.k., now so it seems. Since 2008, just 2 years ago, which is good, but Adobe, since the adquisition of Macromedia on 2005, was holding all the rights on Flash format. ""(not having a good FLOSS Flash player) Not the fault of Adobe..."". Of course not! The fault of Adobe, and this is my personal POW, is developing a very bad quality flash player, for all the users (windows, linux, Solaris). Heck, how in the hell can a company provide such players if they are the developers of the product the players are handling (.swf)? I cannot understand that, and ""that"" precisely makes me doubt about the quality of the format they are trying to populate and rise. That said, even they (they=Adobe)now ""open the specs"" for Flash I will avoid either using it or promoting as much as I can. In the times I worked as webmaster and web designer (now sysadmin), people (clients, partners and my company) ""urged"" me to adopt flash technology, just because ""looked nice"" and, ""(sic) hey, anyone has the Flash Player installed so it was also kinda cross-platform"". Yes, Flash Player was (is) available for many systems but the fact is that that did not change my perception about the suitability of using it. There is nothing you couldn't do with standard html technologies (javascript, css, dom...) that Flash can, so why bother about spending time and money in acquiring a license for Adobe products that were (in those times) the only powerful ones that allowed the development of ""rich sites"" (""rich site"" → Adobe ""dixit"")? Why bother if there was only a unique Flash player out there and was pretty bad quality? Why forcing my users to have to use such player if there were alternatives in a very good shape that were open and compatible? My perception is that web developers wrongly refugiated into flash to escape from the incompatibilities of the web browers, any of them applying different renderings of the elements of the page layout and not following the W3C standards. Yes, Firefox and Opera had also their own glicthes and of course, Internet Explorer. So web developers, instead trying to compatibilize ""the incompatibilities"" of the browsers by making a more fine-grained code, they took the ""easy path"" and just fall into the arms of Flash format: format was bad but hey, at least it renedered the site in the same manner in all the browsers >:-) And then it came html5, promoting open standard ways to handle video and audio... ooops, Adobe must thought their Flash format will be forgotten and lost in the Helm's Deep if html5 will succeed, so the decided to open Flash to be more user-friendly and calm down the accusations about monopolistic tactics, being their flash player installed in more than 95% of the computers >:-) Adn here we are now, with Adobe developing, promoting and enforcing DRM technologies in their products and, OTOH providing an ""open spec"" for flash... quite contradictory :-) That is my personal opinion, of course. >> And the same situation goes for Adobe Reader for Linux. I dunno what is >> going on with Adobe but true is that I dislike the path is taking that >> company :-/ > > I am using Debian GNU/Linux since over 11 years and I have more then 20 > commercial progras like Eagle, FAB3000 and VariCAD with a total value of > more then 80.000 Euro installed, because there are NO Open Source > equivalents available.

Auto-Router? Oh Hell! I now that.

Wow, maybe 8 to 10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude, it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install. What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam. My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms with alsa module) to my ear. The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it. And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st install, that was a long time ago for me. Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel. -- That's ""angle"" as in geometry. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list "

We've taken OP to task already for this, but I guess it bears repeating. Use multiple HW controllers, and at least 7-8 drives, I believe was the consensus, given that SW RAID 6 is a performance loser and losing a controller during a rebuild is a real ruin-your-week kind of moment. But while some of us were skeptical about just how bad the performance of RAID 5 or 6 really is and wanted citation of references, more of us just questioned the perceived frugality. With four drives, wouldn't a RAID 10 be better use of resources, since you can migrate to bigger setups later?

I believe the discussion degenerated into a nit-picky banter over the general suitability of XFS, but I may be wrong about this... _____ Seriously, ext4 is not suitable if you anticipate possible boot problems, unless you are experienced at these things. The same is true of XFS. If you *are* experienced, then more power to you. Although, I would have assumed a very experienced person would have no need to ask the question. Someone pointed out what I have come to regard as the best solution, and that is to make /boot and / (root) and the usual suspects ext3 for safety, and use ext4 or XFS or even btrfs for the data directories. (Unless OP were talking strictly about the data drives to begin with, a possibility I admit I may have overlooked.) Have I summarized adequately?

Many packages simply do not have Debian sources, and I have used KPackage to successfully install many alien packages. In some cases, there may be a reasonable .deb subsitute, but many packages, most notably hardware drives, simply have no substitute. Two of my RAID controllers, for example, only have RPM distros. Surely you are not suggesting a PC - Debian or otherwise - can do without its hard drives?

If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis, these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance. But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable. 						&nbsp; 					 					 				 				 				 			 			 			 			 	 	 	 		 	 	 			 Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users are not affected. Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully, this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users. Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail program open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available. Are Web-based e-mail accounts less virus-prone than Outlook? >Is it true that if I use a Web-based e-mail service such as >Yahoo I'll be safe from Outlook-related viruses? --Charles M. No. Many new viruses do not require a PC-based e-mail client such as Outlook in order to spread. These new viruses, including Klez, have their own e-mail client (SMTP) and can find e-mail addresses within cached Web pages on an infected machine, bypassing the need to use Outlook's Address Book. Larger Web-based e-mail services, such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, screen mail hosted on their sites for viruses, but there's no beating having a good antivirus product on your desktop just in case. --> 		 		 		 	 	 Digital photography starter kit This guide to digital photos will show you the best products to take your images from snap to finish. 		 		 	&#149; Panasonic's littlest Lumix 	&#149; Minolta""s 4-megapixel Dimage F100 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 Most popular products 	 Digital cameras 	1.

I never used ConfigParser before, but I read that its read() method silently ignores files that don't exist. If 'bayes.ini' isn't found, *none* of the options will be defined. Since you want to run this from a directory other than my spambayes directory, it's up to you to check in changes to make that possible . "

I get the same behaviour than you, but only when I attach a special device (GNOME recognizes the mobile phone as some kind of music stuff). Try this: 1/ Plug on the device 2/ Type mount (to get the device listed) 3/ Type ""umount /media/video"" (adjust the command to point the right path) 4/ Type ""mount"" With these steps I get no pop-up or warning messages and the device gets umounted normally.

China? Ooops, no wait, scratch that. There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be precisely ""free trade/markets"" -- when Ben Franklin first visited England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous. Ben explained that they used ""Colonial Script"", a kind of barter-dollar, and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment. The British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to clamp down on the practice. Within a few years, the colonies were rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire. According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were protesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes they were protesting a tea tax. The same pamphlet claimed that Canada was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada. I've wondered about all this. Certainly the timeline of the collapse of the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when we only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this? -- Gary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ - ""Computers are useless.

ham,"[ILUG] connecting at 1200bps in RH7.3 (help!)Hi All, Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side, but the modem handshake always fails at this speed. The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to ~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps. Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows worked first time(!?), any ideas? Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string: AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1 ... which is most of the defaults. USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) & set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2) But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving up. btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their modems may be difficult.

I am running Debian sid on an Apple iMac 27"", with a Mobility Radeon HD 4850 video card (ATI Technologies Inc M98L). The kernel I use is 2.6.33-2 from experimental, and I have disable KMS. Depending on the version of the radeon driver I use, I see or not something on the screen: - with 1:6.12.192-2, everything startx correctly when I launch startx from the command line. - with 1:6.13.0-1, the screen becomes black, and it is impossible to go back to a console using Alt+Ctl+F?. However, I can ssh to the system, and see using ps that the KDE session has indeed started. Here are in attachment the two logs: failed is with 6.13, and success is with 6.12.192.

There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of fair use in the US. For example, audio recordings have such an exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't (legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can control what you do with it after they've sold it to you. Certain industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products -- there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such privileges on. > Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff. Just because you > (and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come > up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't > take it out on the rest of us. The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever accused of pale in comparison. If they can't figure out how to make money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no ""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a profit. They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few people swing a stick large enough. They are being chronically ""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar activities, but that is mostly just for show. Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork "

ham,"RE: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sdraw the pain ""Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in workshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You draw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take about 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully listening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts and where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of this the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to imagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay."" Works! There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass! I used my middle finger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds. I listened to him, found the boundary, and repeated the motion.

Just a big turnoff. A good example would be the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc. (This was one of the many topics I obsessively absorbed as a teenager.) Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / G-Force Dyno-Staff. I have to say however that, having found this while looking for something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms. I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction. Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc. To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize. Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models. I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and justify US/UN foreign policy and actions. http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/ (Apologies for the embedded HTML.)

The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting, permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't vulnerable. The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual' browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the 'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar in the buddy list window. Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also obtain this update from the Ximian FTP site.

It handles multiple 50-60MB mbox files with ease as well as serving Samaba shares containing 5000+ files per dir. Given that the large mbox files become fairly fragmented over time due to constant appends, having an online file defragmenter, xfs_fsr, is very handy. The myth that certain filesystems don't fragment files and thus don't need a defrag tool are just that, myths. I've run with mbox on both EXT2 and XFS, and the larger mbox files always fragment over time regardless of filesystem. Prior to my last xfs_fsr run, I had 10 mbox files (a single user) that ranged from 10-35 fragments each. Those in the 20-35 fragment range were 40-60MB files. I don't have empirical data to show how much this negatively affected performance, but my mail client did seem a bit snappier after defragging. > nilfs2, btrfs and exofs are *definitely* still beta or even alpha.

For production servers I'd go with XFS everywhere as long as your kernel (and rescue disk kernel) has XFS built-in. Reliable power (via UPS and/or generator) is part of the definition of ""production"" server, so there's no reason to shy away from XFS for any partitions or logical volumes due to power loss fears. Some recent FS benchy comparisons with 2.6.34-rc3 on a big RAID setup: http://btrfs.boxacle.net/repository/raid/2010-04-14_2004/2.6.34-rc3/2.6.34-rc3.html As always, no single fs wins across the board. XFS falls flat on its face in the synthetic mail server test, but does very well in all others. Given its results in the mail test are almost identical to EXT4, and that EXT4 no-barrier increases performance 7 fold, I'd say some tweaking of XFS would bring its performance back in line with the others. -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

The electronics and electrical parts in UPSes very rarely fail, so as long as you replace batteries every 5 years or so you'd got reliable power backup, and cheap--$20 per year basically for batteries. This level of power (and piece of mind) protection costs less per year than one trip to the movie theater to see Avatar. I've got an equally old MinuteMan 650 floor model backing my home workstation. Again I purchased this one used from a liquidator (different one in this case) for around $40 back in 1998. I've replaced the battery once after 6 years and am about ready to replace it again. The battery for this one runs around $40. Today you can buy a 700kva class consumer UPS for $100. If the battery lasts you 5 years, you've paid $20/year for power/surge and data protection. Not to mention convenience. I can't imagine ever going without a UPS, whether server or workstation. Laptops are great because, for all practical purposes, you get a free UPS built in. -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards. They have an internal procession unit around 4MHz. Can we consider them as trusted hardware ? The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of ""renting"" the system. Smart card do their own self encryption. Can they be used to decrypt data needed by the system ? The input of the system could me mangled and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.

Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy to read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, allowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) with much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. The Windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in mind. Creating ebooks for TomeRaider is a simple matter of combining a modified set of HTML tags with the designation for page breaks.

Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade, Crane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but truly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by the retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations. Left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane develops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers into town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish the punishers. As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the amorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however, so is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so entertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The Man Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual's year to turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more recent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier noir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand does an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James Gandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding performances, however, rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as pompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and Jon Polito as the snake oil salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their characters. The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane's life and the monochromatic nature of fate.

ham,"Re: [Razor-users] Problem with Razor 2.14 and Spamassassin 2.41This is due to insufficient write privileges to the ""razor-agent.log"" file. A quick work-around is to do a ""chmod go+rx"" on that file (of course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible). In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the ""unblessed"" error.

There are the words and music for more than 1100 songs available on the site and by downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they can even change the key of the song to suit their voice range as well as speed up or slow down the music to their taste. In other words, to have the same experience as they would have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly prepared for your Karaoke.""

He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was the driving force behind this request. What I found was that Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to be included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a default configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that prevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick configuration change and restart of IMS will put things right. &nbsp;GnomeSYSTEM Stop the Presses http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=25802 ... The CD presses, that is.

It's still worth a mention, however, in case you're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or altered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable state. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack, and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command prompt and type ""SFC"" to display a list of options. &nbsp;GnomeSTUFF Consider This Forwarded by JW http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected representatives, you might want to start asking about their opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman gets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack into your systems without proof of provocation in order to ensure that you are using their software according to the stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or upset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in return. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused, consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He was eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more right.

Almost all NICs load firmware blobs. It's in dmesg somewhere. When the firmware doesn't load you get something like this in dmesg: eth1: RTL8168d/8111d at 0xffffc90000c4e000,xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, XID 083000c0 IRQ 32 eth1: unable to apply firmware patch That's a paste from one of the OPs here who was bitten by the 2.6.32-trunk upgrade which IIRC is the one that ripped out the RTL firmware blob. I can't find via Google a dmesg snippet of a successful RTL firmware load. Here's what it looks like for Intel 8255X using the e100 driver, with the firmware blobs all compiled into the kernel: e100 0000:00:0d.0: firmware: using built-in firmware e100/d101m_ucode.bin ""built-in"" signifies that the firmware blob has been included in the kernel at compile time. I do this to avoid issues such as this RTL problem. It only adds a couple hundred K to the kernel image. And I use the vanilla kernel.org sources to avoid any Debian ""non-free"" issues. Just about every NIC on the planet uses a firmware blob. There are, IIRC, 3 ways to load the device firmware into the Linux kernel. This applies to all devices that require soft firmware, not just NICs: 1. Compile all device firmware blobs into the kernel 2. Compile the individual blob into the driver, use initrd 3. Put firmware file in root filesystem, tell kernel the path #3 won't work with drivers that are needed during the boot process such as block device drivers. Those require method 1 or 2. NICs should be able to use 1-3. There are 3 different dmesg statements and 3 different errors depending on which method 1-3 above that you're using. >> At least a couple of people on this list went out and bought >> non-RealTek PCI >> NICs to fix the problem instead of reverting to the older kernel. > > I sort of remember that. Yeah, I just pulled the mails. One upgraded to 2.6.32-trunk on his firewall, bricking it until he disabled the onboard RTL and installed an Intel e100 IIRC. They thought it was a udev issue til I noticed the firmware load failure message referenced up above in this email. The other had an RTL wireless that failed for the same reason. I can't recall how they fixed that one. IIRC the OP didn't swap hardware to achieve the fix, so they did something with the kernel/driver/firmware. > I'm not surprised. Since I'm only connected to a small 100Mbps LAN > which then connects to a 12Mbps cable modem, it doesn't really affect me. Do some FTP or SCP tests back and forth to another LAN machine and see what transfers rates you get out of that RTL chip. I bet you get 1/3rd wire speed at best, about 30MB/s, if even that. The machines themselves need to be modern to saturate the link--no slow CPUs or disks. Any ~2GHz CPU with 512MB RAM and a decent 7.2K RPM SATA disk should be able to push/pull 50MB/s across the wire. For that matter, eliminate the disk by creating a 200MB RAM disk on each machine. Create a test file with dd and FTP/SCP it back and forth between the RAM disks. If your RTL chip can peak the wire it'll be a 2-3 second transfer if your network chips and Linux TCP stacks are up to the task. > Maybe if I ever get .32 or .33 I'll squeal in anger. Until then... It's looking like the RTL firmware blob issue may have been limited to the trunk kernel. You may get lucky. Then again, if you roll your own and put the firmware blobs in the kernel itself as I do, you shouldn't have a problem. That is, if the Debian kernel source doesn't have the blob ripped out for being ""non-free"". You mentioned you had problems building 2.6.32 and .33 kernel source. Do you use the Debian kernel source or kernel.org source? I've been using the kernel.org source for quite some time and have never had any real problems with it (knocks on wood). I had a build problem with .33 a while back but that turned out to be due to a slight bit too much overclock on my machine in this warmer weather. ;) -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

I hear you. I'll have to look at the code to see if that's easily separated out. I started with the purpose of adding an enhancement to support CMS formatted disks. I stumbled across the bug in the starting block calculation for ldl formatted disks in the process. CMS formatted disks are handled *exactly* the same as ldl formatted disks if the disk is not reserved. I would have had to fix that bug anyway to add support for CMS disks, since I wanted the CMS support to be correct. The only wrinkle was correctly handling reserved CMS disks. To do that I had to access the reserved block offset in the CMS label, which prompted this thread. All of this is specific to the s390 architecture and has no bearing on i386, amd64, ia64, etc. I hope upstream (GNU, I believe) will accept the fix.

spam,"News stock alertFrom nobody Mon Mar 5 10:42:13 2018 Content-Type: text/plain; 	charset=""us-ascii"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable euok draft 1 1 Hi Everyone, For all our new members welcome. We are pleased and excited to release our latest pick Euoko Group Inc, = trading symbol EUOK. EUOK is an elite manufacturer of luxury based beauty products, with a f= ocus in anti aging and wrinkle prevention. EUOK gross profit has grown by 102% for the three months ended January = 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2009. Gross profi= t margin for the three months ended was 81%. Sales increased by 88% for = the three months ended January 31, 2010 when compared to the same period = in the prior year. EUOK gross profit has grown by 57% for the six months ended January 31,= 2010 compared to the six months ended January 31, 2009. Gross profit mar= gin for the six months ended was 79%. Sales increased by 49% for the six= months ended January 31, 2010 when compared to the same period in the pr= ior year. When benchmarked against its industry competitors Revlon (REV:NYSE), Es= tee Lauder (EL:NYSE), Shiseido, and LVMH (Euronext: MC), EUOK has had sig= nificantly more sales growth when compared to the same period in the prio= r year. Company Name Sales Growth (3 months ended Q1 2010 compared to 3 months ended Q1 2009) Increase/(Decrease) EUOK 88% Estee Lauder Companies 10% Revlon 0.73% Shiseido (6.7%) LVMH 11% The growth in sales is primarily due to the EUOK brand becoming more es= tablished in the premium cosmetic channels. EUOK current trading price of 0.40 is a steal. We have been following t= he cosmetics and beauty industry now for quite some time. According to Fo= rbes.com who did an article on the growth of the cosmetics industry, beau= ty products generate nearly 230 billion annually in global sales, with a = consumer preference placed on products that are high tech and natural bas= ed (favoring companies like EUOK). With the current status of the company= , EUOK is poised to grab no less than 1% of global sales, ensuring 230 mi= llion in gross sales for EUOK. Based off revenue alone that would warrant= a $6.57 share price. The financials speak for themselves; EUOK is set to make a run and is e= xtremely undervalued. In the past, large multinational corporations have dominated the market= place, but in recent years boutique brands such as EUOK have been at the= fore front of consumer spending. EUOK is ready to take full advantage of= this. Data released from the NPD Group (a marketing info company based i= n New York) says luxury cosmetics have grown at an annual rate of 4% - 7%= since 2002. Estee lauder and L=E2=80=99Oreal have realized this and have= been acquiring companies like EUOK in order to meet the demand of consum= ers. There are several reasons behind the growth in high-end cosmetics: the = expansion of new markets in Russia and Asia; changing social norms that m= ake using cosmetics--not to mention undergoing cosmetic surgery--more acc= eptable; celebrity worship; promotion within fashion magazines; improveme= nts in the technology that creates makeup; the influence of mass retailer= s that can offer lower prices, and raising affluence. As cosmetics become= s less expensive, better and more accessible, more affluent women--and in= creasingly men as well--have moved away from older brands of makeup and s= kincare in search of higher-quality new products and more exclusivity. EUOK recognizes this and has gained retail distribution worldwide throu= gh its relationships with department store retail giants such as Barneys = New York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Bliss, Harr= ods (London), Printemps (France), La Rinascente (Italy) and Lane Crawford= (Hong Kong). Upper management of EUOK has a three prong approach to further drive gl= obal brand recognition: North America EUOK strategy in North America is one of strong luxury brand positionin= g through partnerships with premier department stores and flagship locati= ons. EUOK department store partners include Bergdorf Goodman in New York = City, Barneys New York nationwide, Ogilvy, as well as boutique-style depa= rtment stores across USA and Canada. EUOK also operates brand-owned flags= hip stores in Toronto and Vancouver. EUOK subsidiary, Hewitt-Vevey, is po= sitioned in medical facilities and online, with p lans to grow in both directions. Future expansion plans include creating = new partnerships with other major department stores, as well as positioni= ng with 5-star hotels in key markets. Europe EUOK distribution in Europe varies by market but is restricted to luxur= y channels that position the brand amongst the leading luxury skincare br= ands. Our representation includes department stores and perfumeries in ma= jor markets. These channels include Printemps in France, Harrods and Libe= rty in the UK, La Rinascente in Italy, as well as perfumeries in other co= untries. Expansion plans for Europe are focused primarily in the UK and F= rance with negotiations with premier department stores under way. Asia EUOK distribution in Asia varies by country for best positioning amongs= t the leading luxury brands. Our major department store partner in Hong K= ong is Lane Crawford, as well as Joyce. We are also represented through l= uxury perfumeries and spas in Singapore and South Eastern China. Asia rep= resents our largest immediate growth potential. We are in communication w= ith major department stores and distributors in Japan, South Korea, Taiwa= n and other major markets in China. We expect new accounts for EUOK, as w= ell as major interest in WhiteRX, an upcoming product of our subsidiary, = Hewitt-Vevey, to drive significant growth in Asia. We are also in communi= cation with major retailers in the Middle East and Russia, two high-poten= tial markets in which we are not yet present. Corporate Summary With confidence, we welcome you to Euoko, an exclusive brand that repre= sents the cornerstone of the most innovative, most unique skin treatments= . Euoko indeed stands at the intersection of the most noble of commitment= s to effective active technology, unsurpassed delivery systems, uncomprom= ised service and a modern, understated image. Our constantly growing library of active principles currently exhibits = 102 ingredients from Switzerland, Spain, France, Canada, Denmark, the Uni= ted States, the Amazonian Rainforest, the Kalahari Desert and Denmark. Fr= om our most unique hyaluronic acid with no animal origins or strepp bacte= ria derivatives to our recent addition of an extraordinarily effective, a= ge-killing peptide that fully mimics Waglerin 1, a peptide that is found = in the venom of the Temple Viper, Tropidolaemus wagleri, we stand strongl= y behind the innovative collection of the noble ingredients found in our = products. Both the safety and effectiveness of our ingredients are import= ant to us. We avoid unnecessary preservation or stabilization and respond= rapidly to emerging innovations in biotechnology, nanotechnology, biolog= y, peptides and other active principles. Further, our proprietary delivery system ensures maximum stability and = absorption of our active principles into the skin. This delivery system i= s the single key catalyst that maximizes the effectiveness of our princip= les, while making it possible for high concentrations of our principles t= o be included synergistically in our formulations. Highlights of this sys= tem include a strain of red marine algae that maximizes penetration of ac= tives into the skin by causing a controlled immune response when applied = topically. This effect is enhanced by the delivery action of our micro-su= rfactants bound to a pure grade of hyaluronic acid, as well as our unique= timed-release technology. Every Euoko product embodies Euoko=E2=80=99s c= ommitment to science and quality. When you purchase a Euoko treatment, yo= u stand confident that your purchase represents the latest scientific dis= coveries that are at the forefront of peptide-technology, nanotechnology,= biotechnology and biology =E2=80=93 a class of confidence unknown even i= n the highest class of skincare.

As much as I prefer KDE3, I agree that there is nothing else the Debian developers can do, since to take up KDE3 would require effectively duplicating the entire KDE development team. The dropping of KDE3 is a simple fact of life because it is no longer maintained upstream. I hope the pain will be worth it in the long run.

ham,"[SAtalk] procmail helpI'm fairly confused here, with Procmail. I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com. I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything specific on this scenario. Here's the situation. I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log) At the end of this file, I use :0fw | spamc to call spamassassin. Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do for our corporate masters) (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion on this point is immaterial) :0 * ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR { } :0 c $SAVEAT I have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null . . .their procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this: :0 * ^From: .*spermfun.com /dev/null Now I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her /home/$user/.procmailrc file: :0 c !user@domain.tld It almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with :0 * ^Subject: .*test procmail.holder and get the same result. The result, to put it succinctly, is ""nothing"". No forwards go out, no files are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun example above) and still nothing. However, I can redirect those other messages. In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- other users have no problems. Any suggestions would be helpful :) -Russ ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

However, most netbooks are deliberately crippled, such as allowing only 1 or 2 GB of memory when there is no technical reason why 4 GB shouldn't work. It is a matter of segmenting a market, and manufacturers want netbooks to have specific capabilities for marketing reasons, not technical ones. I wanted to suggest that you choose a machine based on your needs, and I wanted you to question your initial assumptions. However, I see you have done some thinking about it, and future-proofing *does* seem like a good reason to get a dual-core, 64-bit machine. With 64 bits, you will need more memory, so I suggest you look for a machine that can use 4 GB of memory. I suggest also that you make sure that the machine you get can use solid-state storage devices. In time, the advantages of SSDs will make them compelling, though now they are too expensive. That is, you will probably buy a machine with a standard notebook HD, but if you ever need to replace it, being able to replace it with an SSD gives you another option. This also is in the area of future-proofing. Just a couple of suggestions. I would like to hear more from other people. (I am also contemplating a portable computer purchase.)

Electricon Land http://www.electriconland.com/ {Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward to moving to our new neighborhood in a little over a month. Everything is better with a little dash of friendliness, right? Icons are no exception. All the action on this website is based around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be disappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your Avengers icons from the comic store. If all this wasn't good enough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities are endless! Recommend It! &nbsp;GnomeTIP I just hate it when I try to install a program and the installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \ Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data: ""voicewarmup"" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i = Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r = Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit information; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails, I just have to check in the ""Temp"" directory and look for my log files. They'll vary in name, but will always start with ""Msi"" and end with the .LOG extension.

My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes) pickle. hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you write stuff out to a dbm file. With that same message base, the dbm file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB. It also takes longer to write: Using a database: real 8m24.741s user 6m19.410s sys 1m33.650s Using a pickle: real 1m39.824s user 1m36.400s sys 0m2.160s This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says). For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at least for speed) on the same data blazes along: real 0m29.592s user 0m28.050s sys 0m1.180s Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB. However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be able to outperform it. It's something to keep in mind, though. I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages. (Actually, I do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;) In any case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable. On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking down to 1.8MB. Neale "

ham,"Re: Questions about RAID 6Disclaimer: I'm partial to XFS Tim Clewlow put forth on 5/1/2010 2:44 AM: > My reticence to use ext4 / xfs has been due to long cache before > write times being claimed as dangerous in the event of kernel lockup > / power outage. This is a problem with the Linux buffer cache implementation, not any one filesystem. The problem isn't the code itself, but the fact it is a trade off between performance and data integrity. No journaling filesystem will prevent the loss of data in the Linux buffer cache when the machine crashes. What they will do is zero out or delete any files that were not fully written before the crash in order to keep the FS in a consistent state. You will always lose data that's in flight, but your FS won't get corrupted due to the journal replay after reboot. If you are seriously concerned about loss of write data that is in the buffer cache when the system crashes, you should mount your filesystems with ""-o sync"" in the fstab options so all writes get flushed to disk without being queued in the buffer cache. > There are also reports (albeit perhaps somewhat > dated) that ext4/xfs still have a few small but important bugs to be > ironed out - I'd be very happy to hear if people have experience > demonstrating this is no longer true. My preference would be ext4 > instead of xfs as I believe (just my opinion) this is most likely to > become the successor to ext3 in the future. I can't speak well to EXT4, but XFS has been fully production quality for many years, since 1993 on Irix when it was introduced, and since ~2001 on Linux. There was a bug identified that resulted in fs inconsistency after a crash which was fixed in 2007. All bug fix work since has dealt with minor issues unrelated to data integrity. Most of the code fix work for quite some time now has been cleanup work, optimizations, and writing better documentation. Reading the posts to the XFS mailing list is very informative as to the quality and performance of the code. XFS has some really sharp devs. Most are current or former SGI engineers. > I have been wanting to know if ext3 can handle >16TB fs.

On a 64 bit kernel it is 9 exabytes each. XFS is a better solution than EXT4 at this point. Ted T'so admits last week that one function call in EXT4 is in terrible shape and will a lot of work to fix: ""On my todo list is to fix ext4 to not call write_cache_pages() at all. We are seriously abusing that function ATM, since we're not actually writing the pages when we call write_cache_pages(). I won't go into what we're doing, because it's too embarassing, but suffice it to say that we end up calling pagevec_lookup() or pagevec_lookup_tag() *four*, count them *four* times while trying to do writeback. I have a simple patch that gives ext4 our own copy of write_cache_pages(), and then simplifies it a lot, and fixes a bunch of problems, but then I discarded it in favor of fundamentally redoing how we do writeback at all, but it's going to take a while to get things completely right. But I am working to try to fix this."" > I'm also hoping that a cpu/motherboard with suitable grunt and fsb > bandwidth could reduce performance problems with software raid6.

Good hardware RAID cards are really nice and give you some features you can't really get with md raid such as true ""just yank the drive tray out"" hot swap capability. I've not tried it, but I've read that md raid doesn't like it when you just yank an active drive. Fault LED drive, audible warnings, are also nice with HW RAID solutions. The other main advantage is performance. Decent HW RAID is almost always faster than md raid, sometimes by a factor of 5 or more depending on the disk count and RAID level. Typically good HW RAID really trounces md raid performance at levels such as 5, 6, 50, 60, basically anything requiring parity calculations. Sounds like you're more of a casual user who needs lots of protected disk space but not necessarily absolute blazing speed. Linux RAID should be fine. Take a closer look at XFS before making your decision on a FS for this array. It's got a whole lot to like, and it has features to exactly tune XFS to your mdadm RAID setup. In fact it's usually automatically done for you as mkfs.xfs queries the block device device driver for stride and width info, then matches it.

We site a number of reasons including fscking 5.5T of disk is long and painful, we were hitting various cache issues, and we were seeking better performance out of our file system."" ""After initial tests looked positive we made the jump, and have been quite happy with the results. With an instant increase in performance and throughput, as well as the worst xfs_check we've ever seen taking 10 minutes, we were quite happy. Subsequently we've moved all primary mirroring file-systems to XFS, including www.kernel.org , and mirrors.kernel.org. With an average constant movement of about 400mbps around the world, and with peaks into the 3.1gbps range serving thousands of users simultaneously it's been a file system that has taken the brunt we can throw at it and held up spectacularly."" -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

ham,"A couple of nits... I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues or my setup issues. First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap. Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages rather than to the first unseen in the current folder. Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages. (When I goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go). Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting some different than I should be.

You're private The original comment's context was digital signatures. A digital signature is worth sqrat if any userspace app or rogue superuser code can grab your keyring in clear, and send out stuff in your name. A passphrase unlocking the keyring for that particular use is a minimal protection (since not immune to passphrase snarfers), but this is much, much better than always leaving your key in the lock.

A passphrase is a (long, secure) password unlocking (decrypting) your keyring. You don't use a passphrase to read your email.

ham,"[Razor-users] can't call method ""log"" issue - solution I see that Robert S. Wojciechowski Jr. posted about this issue on 7/26, but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user. The way I solved it was to run razor-admin -create and razor-admin -discover with a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe. The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a .razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist (although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to razorhome on the command line, e.g. razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discover hth, Steve -- hesketh.com/inc. v: (919) 834-2552 f: (919) 834-2554 w: http://hesketh.com ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

ham,"RE: [SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why?Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get. Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers. Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried. We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of. We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts. We can use private investigators. Yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners). But, they're not secret agents. They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before. Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark. Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation. If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release. But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise. At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours. Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars. But only if we're given a chance to succeed. - dan -- Dan Kohn -----Original Message----- From: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38 To: Matthew Cline Cc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T.

Just a few notes: - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information! I don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright. Also, some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example, ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components, replcomps, forwcomps and so on). That way you get them when you are editing your message.

I had a renice script to get all those akonadi daemons niced out of the way so kde4 would be usable. One version (4.2.*) had stuff starting at 0, priority 40 (did not know there was such an animal) but it played nicely. After that, it seems, everything of kde4's menus, desktop icons, anything it spawns is being niced to 19. This renders kde4 unusable. So my renicer script sets plasma-desktop, kmail and several of the core utilities back to 0 so I can use it. But this workaround is no answer. I have no idea why this is going on.

Its relevance is nil. It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the point of the earlier 3-person example. But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' ""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you. Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche ""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you reverse the male and female roles. Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts""). > So I chose not to type ""on average"" explicitly in my post, since this > is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue. > > There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested > in typical behaviour and you in extreme. Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to make it more defensible. What I objected to was: Robert Harley: # >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous # >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended. # # Well, DUH!!! # # It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, # precisely identical between males and females. # # Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ. If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, precisely identical""? If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an anthrolopology professor's conclusions? > Actually, you probably just > had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it. You are welcome to that theory!

My > approach would have been just making the 'hold' action also clear > the 'automatically installed' flag; essentially ""institutionalizing"" > the temporary solution. But, I defer to your solution as it sounds > more flexible. I'm also not familiar with the implementation, but I would prefer that automatically installed packages stay automatically installed, so that they have the possibility of being automatically removed when no longer needed. I use ""hold"" liberally to weather Sid storms. There are two cases I see crop up: one, aptitude suggests removing packages without an obvious replacement. Two, aptitude marks things as broken that have been working just fine. In either case, I start slamming the ""="" key until packages will no longer be removed, and nothing is marked broken. This works 99.99% of the time. At some later period when I suspect the storm has passed, I test the waters by unholding the packages and gauging aptitude's reaction. I also use ""hold"" when apt-listbugs + some investigation leads me to believe I'm better off with the current version. (There's some reason I don't use forbid-version, but I don't recall. Maybe it wasn't persisting between sessions? But that would have been years ago.) All of which is to say, just because I've marked a package on hold doesn't mean that I want it on my system forever. But if that's the only way to deal with the problem, then I can certainly manage. My system is ancient, and there are already plenty of package on it whose presence I can't easily explained. What's the harm in a few more? If this is a misuse of ""hold"" and there's a better way, though, I'm all ears. Rereading, it seems like ""forbid-version"" would be the right call for most of what I'm doing, assuming it does persist between aptitude sessions. -- monique -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

Well, Unicode, specifically the UTF-8 encoding, is generally the standard for modern Linux systems. Of course, as long as you are using only characters that are in ASCII, UTF-8 is compatible... There is also GB 18030, China's Unicode encoding, but again, it is ASCII compatible. The Win32, .NET and Java platforms all use UTF-16/USC-2 (it's complicated) natively, which is not ASCII and is not ASCII compatible.

I'll give you an example. Use XFS on LVM, and export the mount over NFS. The nested system calls in this scenario will cause a kernel oops on any 4K 32-bit kernel nearly every time (the default for Debian GNU/Linux, Fedora, Ubuntu, openSUSE, etc). On a 64-bit kernel, because you have the ability to make deeper nested system calls, you have stability in your infrastructure.

China? Ooops, no wait, scratch that. There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be precisely ""free trade/markets"" -- when Ben Franklin first visited England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous. Ben explained that they used ""Colonial Script"", a kind of barter-dollar, and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment. The British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to clamp down on the practice. Within a few years, the colonies were rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire. According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were protesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes they were protesting a tea tax. The same pamphlet claimed that Canada was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada. I've wondered about all this. Certainly the timeline of the collapse of the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when we only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this? -- Gary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ - ""Computers are useless.

ham,"[WM] The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14)-------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is MIME? MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"". It is the standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the world-wide Internet email system. Typical uses of MIME include sending images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file. MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message? Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use which do not understand MIME messages. However, there are a growing number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in. (One popular MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z) In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation capability in their Internet gateway products. However, even if you do not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is still hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME message. One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"". It was developed at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/. There are versions available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems. For compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE? Yes. UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems. MIME uses a more robust encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME? The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: o US East Coast Address: ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10) o US West Coast Address: ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32) o Pacific Rim Address: munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21) o Europe Address: nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt Another source of information is the Internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"", which includes a periodic posting of a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" list. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

Recently several companies have started displaying a large favicon in the address bar when you go to their site. In several cases it takes up over half of the space in the address bar and makes it extremely difficult to read the URL. One site even claimed that this is a ""security feature"" as it would enable the users to tell they were really on the bank's site and not some scammer of phisher site. Sure! Like nobody else could figure out how to do that! Anyway, can anyone tell me how to get rid of these eyesores?

I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up. In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example : rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY (this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages) Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who verify against an imported gpg key?

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

ham,"SunWell, it looks like Sun are going ahead with their ubiquitous computing plans without Mithril. Greg Reuters Market News Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET By Peter Henderson SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1. It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals making computers which manage networks. EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break. ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever needed. For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from different vendors to interoperate closely. Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response time for priority users, the company said.

Nice trick. One thing - to save an image as an animated GIF (for example), you just do a save as, and set the extension to .gif - you should get a dialog asking whether you want to merge visible layers or save as an animation. I believe that you can also specify the extension as .mpg or .mpeg if you've got the mpeg plug-in built.

spam,"What Warren Buffett won't tell ya ...It was the Spring of 1979. I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids' lunch money. No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said, ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week."" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn't even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead. Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW. According to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is ""NEVER"". In a sense, they are right. If you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. But here's the problem: Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich? Hell no! You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair. If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? Where would you travel? What kind of car would you buy? The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. You want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE. That's how you're going to make the money. What I'm talking about here is day trading. My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars. They make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ... The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, I've learned the following lessons: ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** Anyone can do it. ** It only takes a few hours to learn. When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become wealthy overnight. If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, I had made my first million. The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book, the Master Trader. You will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year. The income of the day trader can be staggering. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes. The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge. I will provide that knowledge, and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you: *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down. *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds. *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make. *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings. *** Make money on the biggest news stories. *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use. *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell? Or am I going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"" Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself? With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars. The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your own financial future. Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market. Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH. Oops, they weren't laughing anymore. In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth. If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game. But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now. I promise to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading. You don't need to know anything about the market, and anyone can do it, with minimum effort. It's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move.

You should run ""aptitude unmarkauto grub-legacy"" and remove the transitional grub package. Unfortunately the case where a transitional package A pulls in another package B is not handled well by the package managers, I always end up ""aptitude unmarkauto B; aptitude markauto A"" to tell apt that I want to keep the new package and that it can remove the transitional one as soon as nothing depends on it anymore. > The following NEW packages will be installed: > ... grub-pc{a} ... > > So why does aptitude pay no attention to my pin? Because it decides that the grub-legacy package is unused and can be removed despite the pin. Whether this is the right thing is debatable; I'm sure you find some bug reports about that if you dig into the long list of aptitude bugs.

spam,"SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''. Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije. Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije. Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke. Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva. Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova. Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu. Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica. Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti. Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava. Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD. Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima. Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat? _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4 "
ham,"Resources for learning LinuxFrom nobody Mon Mar 5 10:42:13 2018 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Hello, I've been using linux (debian) for about a year now, and although I'm no longer scared of the command line I would like to do a little reading/studying of linux to get a better understanding of some of the more advanced topics, or to see if I have learned a lot of the things that might be taught in a university-linux/UNIX course. I'm sure that there is a lot of stuff that I've missed by just going at it with trial and error. Perhaps there are some online courses posted to youtube, or a few books that someone might like to recommend? I would be interested to know what types of things one must learn to get ""linux-certification"" (I presume there is such a thing). Regards, James "

It doesn't look too hard. Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package did. For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from , but I'm not going to work on it anymore. I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's booty-kicking tokenizer). I'll probably have something soon, like maybe half an hour, and no, it's not too hard. The hard part is storing the data somewhere. I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a person can just drop in with a default Python install. So anydbm is looking like my best option. I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which does the same sort of thing. You call it from procmail, it adds a new header, and then you can filter on that header. Really easy. Here's how I envision this working. Everybody gets four new mailboxes: train-eggs train-spam trained-eggs trained-spam You copy all your spam and eggs* into the ""train-"" boxes as you get it. How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over anything which was misclassified. Then, every night, the spam fairy swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam. After she's done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders. This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read their mail right off the server. I've spoken with some fellows at work about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well. Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to train-eggs"". Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd start showing up in mail clients. That's the ""delete as spam"" button Paul Graham was talking about. * The Hormel company might not think well of using the word ""ham"" as the opposite of ""spam"", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of their product name for things thus far. So I propose we start calling non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as ""eggs"". Neale "

I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up. In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example : rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY (this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages) Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who verify against an imported gpg key?

So I'm not > about to place blame. Just reporting my experience. One more salvo on X and cut/paste. X specifies at least two *mechanisms* for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*. Windows and Macintosh have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy. I'm quite sure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately. The PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection on your X display. The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit Copy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh. However, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is another archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today) by versions of emacs. Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these mechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great. I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in Text_Selection and report what works well for them. We may come up with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models. Of course, that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that. -- Brent Welch Software Architect, Panasas Inc Pioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network www.panasas.com welch@panasas.com _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users "

ham,"[unison-announce] New unison beta-release (2.9.20) now available------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~--> 4 DVDs Free +s&p Join Now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6YBB/NXiEAA/Ey.GAA/26EolB/TM ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-> A new version of unison is now available for testing. It incorporates several small improvements over 2.9.1, but the main change is a fix to a bug that had potentially serious safety consequences, but only for the very small number of users that are in the habit of running more than one instance of Unison at a time, in parallel. These users are strongly encouraged to upgrade. Others can wait if they wish. The release includes pre-built executables for Linux and Solaris, but not Windows. (We are looking for a Unison-Windows maintainer -- at the moment, none of the active developers are regularly using Unison on Windows, and we do not have a machine that is configured properly for building executables for export.) Grab it from here: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download.html Enjoy, -- Benjamin Changes since 2.9.1: * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number of simultaneous file transfers. * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files are stored. * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo' and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks will not be synchronized correctly.) * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g. synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for this suggestion. * Several small user interface improvements * Documentation + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web page. + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance tuning. * Makefile + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk installed + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX Changes since 2.8.1: * Changing profile works again under Windows * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by a boolean option ``xferbycopying''. * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.] * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically linked). * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and Unix * Small improvements: + If neither the tt USERPROFILE nor the tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put its temporary commit log (called tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use tt C:. + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no = false; default = auto. + -silent implies -contactquietly * Source code: + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific stuff can be made available for other projects.) + several Makefile and docs changes (for release); + further comments in ``update.ml''; + connection information is not stored in global variables anymore. Changes since 2.7.78: * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs after Unison exited). Changes since 2.7.39: * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs are now both accessible). * User manual revised. * Added some new preferences: + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh programs. + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server'' message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI). * Bug fixes: + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to change. + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode. + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI. (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes things.) + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.) * User interface and Unison behavior: + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI. + Added exit status for the textual user interface. + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or errors during update detection are now noted in the log file. + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of failing. + Made some improvements to the error messages. + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml. Changes since 2.7.7: * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system. It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight, non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This version appears stable. Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to the user interface and logging, for example: + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the beginning, one for the end. + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left by a previous unison run, because warning does not work nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by the user. They take the form .# . .unison.tmp. * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a previous run. * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g., when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume mounted.) * Small improvements and bug fixes: + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their prefs files may now get error reports. + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name and line number. + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed only in identical ways since last sync.'' + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference files. + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first marshaled. + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously changing file: unison will give up after certain number of retries. + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger (force=older preference not working). * Compilation: + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk 1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under Windows). + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports building dynamically linked unison executables. Changes since 2.7.4: * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup sequence. Changes since 2.7.1: * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are added to. * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an error message.) Changes since 2.6.59: * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is default. * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not mentioned in the manual any more. * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file contents. * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure that the server times out if the communication link is unexpectedly broken. * Bug fixes: + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination file. + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind a followed link. + Several other small fixes. Changes since 2.6.38: * Major Windows performance improvement! We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking for updates in large replicas. When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as 'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates, instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time, modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However, Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have overlooked an update. Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested. If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what Unison is doing. * New functionality: centralized backups and merging + This version incorporates two pieces of major new functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to individual files. + Centralized backups: o Unison now maintains full backups of the last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in each replica; these function both as backups in the usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking external merge programs. o The backed up files are stored in a directory /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this directory can be changed by setting the environment variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.) o The predicate backup controls which files are actually backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *' causes backing up of all files. o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison updates its archive. This means that # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the archive files have been manually deleted), all files will be backed up. # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first time unison propagates an update for it. o The preference backupversions controls how many previous versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e., the last synchronized version plus one backup). o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is also still supported, but backup is now preferred. o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup directory (or to throw away the directory itself). Before unison uses any of these files for anything important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the one that it expects. + Merging: o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command, invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected). o The actual merging is performed by an external program. The preferences merge and merge2 control how this program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file (see the backup preference), then the merge preference is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In both cases, the value of the preference should be a string representing the command that should be passed to a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string, the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as follows before invoking the command: # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy of the file; # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary file, into which the contents of the remote copy of the file have been transferred by Unison prior to performing the merge; # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file that Unison expects to be written by the merge program when it finishes, giving the desired new contents of the file; and # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy of the original version of the file (i.e., its state at the end of the last successful run of Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not merge2). For example, on Unix systems setting the merge preference to merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for merging. A large number of external merging programs are available. For example, emacs users may find the following convenient: merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" nil ""NEW"")' merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")' (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid running off the edge of the page. In your preference file, each should be written on a single line.) o If the external program exits without leaving any file at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison considers the merge to have succeeded but to have generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke an external editor so that the user can resolve the conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs. o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give several examples in the manual. * Smaller changes: + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf, as it did before. (This change means that included preference files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file' dialog.) + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger, but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library modules being available. + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting the propagation direction exactly backwards. + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does not exist. + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in reverse order in the user interface. * For developers: + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective developers with navigating the code. Changes since 2.6.11: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath in existing profiles should be changed to path. Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile and on the command line. You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile into two: default.prf = root = blah root = foo include common common.prf = Now do unison common root1 root2 when you want to specify roots explicitly. * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.) The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is also set. The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities on a one-off basis via the Actions menu. * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be relocated without changing the name of the archive file where Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for more information.) * Graphical user-interface: + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from scratch. + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may have been selected for a set of changes currently being displayed will be discarded.) + Each profile may include a preference 'label = ' giving a descriptive string that described the options selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed in the top-right corner of the main Unison window. * Minor: + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to order the files backwards relative to the main user interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.) + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically fall back to the textual user interface. + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be skipped. + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements. Changes since 2.6.1: * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for directories. * Preference files may now include lines of the form include , which will cause name.prf to be read at that point. * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now works properly. * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context. * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd preference if there is one, or else just unison. * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.) * Lot of small bugs fixed. Changes since 2.5.31: * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log file seems useful for most users. * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks). Changes since 2.5.25: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again). * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed. Changes since 2.5.1: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * New functionality: + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and group-ids. These new features are controlled by a set of new preferences, all of which are currently false by default. o When the times preference is set to true, file modification times are propaged. (Because the representations of time may not have the same granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will get them as close as the operating systems involved allow.) o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership information is synchronized. o When the group preference is set to true, group information is synchronized. o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and group information is synchronized numerically. By default, owner and group numbers are converted to names on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never mapped via user/group names even if this preference is not set.) + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this preference to -1. + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else, set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want Unison to use. + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored, whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does not match any ignorenot patterns.) * User-interface improvements: + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same order as they were given on the command line or in the preferences file. + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on going. + Added a new preference for controlling how many status messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1. + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem very useful, and there were too many preferences for controlling output in various ways. + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one that will be used if the user just types ) instead of all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of possibilities. + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of the archive file used to remember which files have been synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system call. However, if the environment variable UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it is a laptop and gets moved around a lot). + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is configured to synchronize them. * For hackers: + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which means we can throw away our local patched version. If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources, you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers release, available from http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit challenging.) + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to contribute their programming energies. There is also a separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs. + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being maintained and no longer compiles). + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional information that should be useful for identifying sources of problems. + The version number of the remote server is now checked right away during the connection setup handshake, rather than later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either client or server.) + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a link to them. * Bug fixes: + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of the replicas is on a windows machine). + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported as having changed during synchronization. This should be fixed. + Numerous smaller fixes. Changes since 2.4.1: * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This behavior can be changed in the following ways: + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly created files to be displayed before changed files. + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing order of size. + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where is a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow' patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed first. + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed last. The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface. * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead of a synchronizer. + Giving the preference prefer with argument (by adding -prefer to the command line or prefer= ) to your profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of should be propagated to the other replica (with no questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as usual. + Giving the preference force with argument will make unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root, even if it was the other replica that was changed. These options should be used with care! (More information is available in the manual.) * Small changes: + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive). + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync compression is now enabled by default). + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which direction changes are being propagated are printed differently when the user has overridded Unison's default recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such arrows in a different color. + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility. + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual. Changes since 2.3.12: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * New/improved functionality: + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true, the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default setting is false.) + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to be listed before other updates in the user interface. + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port. + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.) + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are given but no profile is given on the command line. The new behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The manual claimed that this case would work by reading no profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true. + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always listed first + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh' command.) + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report a spurious conflict) * Improvements for the Windows version: + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior is described in the cross-platform section of the manual. + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares, e.g., //host/drive/path. + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug: Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows. * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no longer being maintained): + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's default recommendation. + More colorful appearance. + The initial profile selection window works better. + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the top). + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of total bytes that have been transferred so far. * Improvements to the text user interface: + The file details will be displayed automatically when a conflict is been detected. + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode. + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time it waits for user interaction. + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when asked whether to propagate changes. + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more questions. * Documentation and installation changes: + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common problems and on tricks contributed by users. + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly say what are the current stable and beta-test version numbers. + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers' version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at any given time!) are now available from the download page. + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames) * Many small bug fixes and random improvements. Changes since 2.3.1: * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a 'rename' error. Changes since 2.2: * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default. (It is not stable enough yet.) * Various bug fixes. * A new experimental feature: The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing the contents of that directory. Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the * from being interpreted by your shell. If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command line or in the preferences file.) Changes since 2.1: * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on. * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers, showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far. * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is incremented on every significant public release and the third component is the ``patch level.'' * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface. * The manual is now available in PDF format. * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the release version of Unison. If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the end.) Changes since 1.292: * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all the files in both repositories). * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail after the client exits. * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally). Changes since 1.231: * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions. * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do: you may not notice much speedup yet.) * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem, written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version, you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.) Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded clients/servers can interoperate. * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting development effort to the GTK interface from now on. * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by default). * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use unison- instead of just unison as the remote server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the client, the same version will be selected on the server. Changes since 1.219: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including: + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not working. + umask is now ignored when creating directories + directories are create writable, so that a read-only directory and its contents can be propagated. + Handling of warnings generated by the server. + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both sides is now flagged as erroneous. + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant roots. o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself, which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the link is completely invisible) o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not calculate the working directory into which to write changes. This should be fixed. * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive files. * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond better. * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going back to previous items) * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be easier to find / download things now. Changes since 1.200: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows. * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the same time as the replicas are being changed by the user. * Internal performance improvements. Changes since 1.190: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the amount of memory allocation, especially during the first synchronization. This should help power users with very big replicas. * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later release. * Miscellaneous bug fixes. Changes since 1.180: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns. * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from working correctly when click-started. * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were causing spurious reports of different permissions when synchronizing between windows and unix systems. * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large replicas. Changes since 1.169: * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files. * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing functions. Some power users have reported success with very large replicas. * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an appropriate ignore pattern in your profile. * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has changed. Instead of putting a line of the form ignore = in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put: ignore = Regexp Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized: ignore = Name matches any path in which one component matches , while ignore = Path matches exactly the path . Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in and : + a ? matches any single character except / + a * matches any sequence of characters not including / + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z } + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc. See the user manual for some examples. Changes since 1.146: * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please give it a try and let us know. * Major additions to the documentation. Changes since 1.142: * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes. * Major additions to the user manual. * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical UI from a desktop icon. * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such signal' exception. Changes since 1.139: * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade. * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything. * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such signal' exception. Changes since 1.111: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files in the .unison directory have changed. In particular: + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf. * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the manual for details. * You can now have different preference files in your .unison directory. If you start unison like this unison profilename (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of default.prf. * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server is left running.) * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode server has finished initalization.) * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack around with. * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make Unison better. Changes in Version 2.9.20 Changes since 2.9.1: * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number of simultaneous file transfers. * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files are stored. * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo' and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks will not be synchronized correctly.) * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g. synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for this suggestion. * Several small user interface improvements * Documentation + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web page. + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance tuning. * Makefile + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk installed + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX Changes since 2.8.1: * Changing profile works again under Windows * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by a boolean option ``xferbycopying''. * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.] * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically linked). * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and Unix * Small improvements: + If neither the tt USERPROFILE nor the tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put its temporary commit log (called tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use tt C:. + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no = false; default = auto. + -silent implies -contactquietly * Source code: + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific stuff can be made available for other projects.) + several Makefile and docs changes (for release); + further comments in ``update.ml''; + connection information is not stored in global variables anymore. Changes since 2.7.78: * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs after Unison exited). Changes since 2.7.39: * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs are now both accessible). * User manual revised. * Added some new preferences: + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh programs. + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server'' message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI). * Bug fixes: + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to change. + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode. + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI. (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes things.) + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.) * User interface and Unison behavior: + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI. + Added exit status for the textual user interface. + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or errors during update detection are now noted in the log file. + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of failing. + Made some improvements to the error messages. + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml. Changes since 2.7.7: * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system. It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight, non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This version appears stable. Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to the user interface and logging, for example: + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the beginning, one for the end. + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left by a previous unison run, because warning does not work nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by the user. They take the form .# . .unison.tmp. * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a previous run. * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g., when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume mounted.) * Small improvements and bug fixes: + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their prefs files may now get error reports. + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name and line number. + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed only in identical ways since last sync.'' + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference files. + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first marshaled. + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously changing file: unison will give up after certain number of retries. + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger (force=older preference not working). * Compilation: + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk 1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under Windows). + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports building dynamically linked unison executables. Changes since 2.7.4: * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup sequence. Changes since 2.7.1: * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are added to. * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an error message.) Changes since 2.6.59: * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is default. * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not mentioned in the manual any more. * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file contents. * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure that the server times out if the communication link is unexpectedly broken. * Bug fixes: + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination file. + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind a followed link. + Several other small fixes. Changes since 2.6.38: * Major Windows performance improvement! We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking for updates in large replicas. When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as 'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates, instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time, modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However, Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have overlooked an update. Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested. If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what Unison is doing. * New functionality: centralized backups and merging + This version incorporates two pieces of major new functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to individual files. + Centralized backups: o Unison now maintains full backups of the last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in each replica; these function both as backups in the usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking external merge programs. o The backed up files are stored in a directory /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this directory can be changed by setting the environment variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.) o The predicate backup controls which files are actually backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *' causes backing up of all files. o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison updates its archive. This means that # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the archive files have been manually deleted), all files will be backed up. # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first time unison propagates an update for it. o The preference backupversions controls how many previous versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e., the last synchronized version plus one backup). o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is also still supported, but backup is now preferred. o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup directory (or to throw away the directory itself). Before unison uses any of these files for anything important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the one that it expects. + Merging: o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command, invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected). o The actual merging is performed by an external program. The preferences merge and merge2 control how this program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file (see the backup preference), then the merge preference is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In both cases, the value of the preference should be a string representing the command that should be passed to a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string, the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as follows before invoking the command: # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy of the file; # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary file, into which the contents of the remote copy of the file have been transferred by Unison prior to performing the merge; # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file that Unison expects to be written by the merge program when it finishes, giving the desired new contents of the file; and # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy of the original version of the file (i.e., its state at the end of the last successful run of Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not merge2). For example, on Unix systems setting the merge preference to merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for merging. A large number of external merging programs are available. For example, emacs users may find the following convenient: merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" nil ""NEW"")' merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")' (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid running off the edge of the page. In your preference file, each should be written on a single line.) o If the external program exits without leaving any file at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison considers the merge to have succeeded but to have generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke an external editor so that the user can resolve the conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs. o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give several examples in the manual. * Smaller changes: + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf, as it did before. (This change means that included preference files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file' dialog.) + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger, but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library modules being available. + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting the propagation direction exactly backwards. + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does not exist. + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in reverse order in the user interface. * For developers: + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective developers with navigating the code. Changes since 2.6.11: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath in existing profiles should be changed to path. Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile and on the command line. You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile into two: default.prf = root = blah root = foo include common common.prf = Now do unison common root1 root2 when you want to specify roots explicitly. * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.) The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is also set. The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities on a one-off basis via the Actions menu. * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be relocated without changing the name of the archive file where Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for more information.) * Graphical user-interface: + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from scratch. + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may have been selected for a set of changes currently being displayed will be discarded.) + Each profile may include a preference 'label = ' giving a descriptive string that described the options selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed in the top-right corner of the main Unison window. * Minor: + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to order the files backwards relative to the main user interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.) + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically fall back to the textual user interface. + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be skipped. + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements. Changes since 2.6.1: * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for directories. * Preference files may now include lines of the form include , which will cause name.prf to be read at that point. * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now works properly. * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context. * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd preference if there is one, or else just unison. * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.) * Lot of small bugs fixed. Changes since 2.5.31: * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log file seems useful for most users. * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks). Changes since 2.5.25: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again). * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed. Changes since 2.5.1: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * New functionality: + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and group-ids. These new features are controlled by a set of new preferences, all of which are currently false by default. o When the times preference is set to true, file modification times are propaged. (Because the representations of time may not have the same granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will get them as close as the operating systems involved allow.) o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership information is synchronized. o When the group preference is set to true, group information is synchronized. o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and group information is synchronized numerically. By default, owner and group numbers are converted to names on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never mapped via user/group names even if this preference is not set.) + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this preference to -1. + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else, set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want Unison to use. + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored, whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does not match any ignorenot patterns.) * User-interface improvements: + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same order as they were given on the command line or in the preferences file. + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on going. + Added a new preference for controlling how many status messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1. + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem very useful, and there were too many preferences for controlling output in various ways. + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one that will be used if the user just types ) instead of all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of possibilities. + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of the archive file used to remember which files have been synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system call. However, if the environment variable UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it is a laptop and gets moved around a lot). + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is configured to synchronize them. * For hackers: + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which means we can throw away our local patched version. If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources, you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers release, available from http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit challenging.) + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to contribute their programming energies. There is also a separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs. + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being maintained and no longer compiles). + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional information that should be useful for identifying sources of problems. + The version number of the remote server is now checked right away during the connection setup handshake, rather than later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either client or server.) + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a link to them. * Bug fixes: + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of the replicas is on a windows machine). + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported as having changed during synchronization. This should be fixed. + Numerous smaller fixes. Changes since 2.4.1: * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This behavior can be changed in the following ways: + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly created files to be displayed before changed files. + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing order of size. + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where is a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow' patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed first. + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed last. The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface. * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead of a synchronizer. + Giving the preference prefer with argument (by adding -prefer to the command line or prefer= ) to your profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of should be propagated to the other replica (with no questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as usual. + Giving the preference force with argument will make unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root, even if it was the other replica that was changed. These options should be used with care! (More information is available in the manual.) * Small changes: + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive). + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync compression is now enabled by default). + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which direction changes are being propagated are printed differently when the user has overridded Unison's default recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such arrows in a different color. + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility. + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual. Changes since 2.3.12: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * New/improved functionality: + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true, the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default setting is false.) + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to be listed before other updates in the user interface. + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port. + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.) + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are given but no profile is given on the command line. The new behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The manual claimed that this case would work by reading no profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true. + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always listed first + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh' command.) + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report a spurious conflict) * Improvements for the Windows version: + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior is described in the cross-platform section of the manual. + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares, e.g., //host/drive/path. + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug: Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows. * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no longer being maintained): + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's default recommendation. + More colorful appearance. + The initial profile selection window works better. + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the top). + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of total bytes that have been transferred so far. * Improvements to the text user interface: + The file details will be displayed automatically when a conflict is been detected. + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode. + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time it waits for user interaction. + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when asked whether to propagate changes. + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more questions. * Documentation and installation changes: + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common problems and on tricks contributed by users. + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly say what are the current stable and beta-test version numbers. + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers' version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at any given time!) are now available from the download page. + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames) * Many small bug fixes and random improvements. Changes since 2.3.1: * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a 'rename' error. Changes since 2.2: * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default. (It is not stable enough yet.) * Various bug fixes. * A new experimental feature: The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing the contents of that directory. Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the * from being interpreted by your shell. If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command line or in the preferences file.) Changes since 2.1: * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on. * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers, showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far. * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is incremented on every significant public release and the third component is the ``patch level.'' * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface. * The manual is now available in PDF format. * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the release version of Unison. If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the end.) Changes since 1.292: * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all the files in both repositories). * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail after the client exits. * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally). Changes since 1.231: * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions. * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do: you may not notice much speedup yet.) * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem, written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version, you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.) Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded clients/servers can interoperate. * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting development effort to the GTK interface from now on. * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by default). * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use unison- instead of just unison as the remote server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the client, the same version will be selected on the server. Changes since 1.219: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including: + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not working. + umask is now ignored when creating directories + directories are create writable, so that a read-only directory and its contents can be propagated. + Handling of warnings generated by the server. + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both sides is now flagged as erroneous. + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant roots. o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself, which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the link is completely invisible) o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not calculate the working directory into which to write changes. This should be fixed. * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive files. * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond better. * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going back to previous items) * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be easier to find / download things now. Changes since 1.200: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows. * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the same time as the replicas are being changed by the user. * Internal performance improvements. Changes since 1.190: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the amount of memory allocation, especially during the first synchronization. This should help power users with very big replicas. * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later release. * Miscellaneous bug fixes. Changes since 1.180: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow. * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns. * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from working correctly when click-started. * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were causing spurious reports of different permissions when synchronizing between windows and unix systems. * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large replicas. Changes since 1.169: * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files. * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing functions. Some power users have reported success with very large replicas. * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an appropriate ignore pattern in your profile. * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has changed. Instead of putting a line of the form ignore = in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put: ignore = Regexp Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized: ignore = Name matches any path in which one component matches , while ignore = Path matches exactly the path . Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in and : + a ? matches any single character except / + a * matches any sequence of characters not including / + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z } + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc. See the user manual for some examples. Changes since 1.146: * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please give it a try and let us know. * Major additions to the documentation. Changes since 1.142: * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes. * Major additions to the user manual. * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical UI from a desktop icon. * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such signal' exception. Changes since 1.139: * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade. * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything. * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such signal' exception. Changes since 1.111: * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files in the .unison directory have changed. In particular: + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf. * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the manual for details. * You can now have different preference files in your .unison directory. If you start unison like this unison profilename (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of default.prf. * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server is left running.) * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode server has finished initalization.) * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack around with. * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make Unison better.

I'll never understand. How hot it feels is affected by both temperature and humidity. In Mississippi they have lots of humidity, in the Southwest, we don't. As I know from experience, Mississippi feels a lot hotter at 90 degrees F. than home (Santa Fe) does at 90. Perhaps the military didn't want to train in a real desert because 1) it get's over 100 degrees and any time the air temp is greater than body temp it affects performance, and 2) when those troops go to a real desert they'll think it's so much nicer than Mississippi.

ham,"CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP Original release date: July 22, 2002 Last revised: -- Source: CERT/CC A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file. Systems Affected * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 Overview A vulnerability has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP and/or the web server. I. Description PHP is a popular scripting language in widespread use. For more information about PHP, see http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php The vulnerability occurs in the portion of PHP code responsible for handling file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a specially crafted POST request to the web server, an attacker can corrupt the internal data structures used by PHP. Specifically, an intruder can cause an improperly initialized memory structure to be freed. In most cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or the web server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to take advantage of this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. You may be aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some implementations of malloc and free does not usually result in the execution of arbitrary code. However, because PHP utilizes its own memory management system, the implementation of malloc and free is irrelevant to this problem. Stefan Esser of e-matters GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot execute code on x86 systems. However, we encourage system administrators to apply patches on x86 systems as well to guard against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures. This vulnerability was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described in detail in their advisory. The PHP Group has also issued an advisory. A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115. Although this vulnerability only affects PHP 4.2.0 and 4.2.1, e-matters GmbH has previously identified vulnerabilities in older versions of PHP. If you are running older versions of PHP, we encourage you to review http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html II. Impact A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. An attacker may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due to the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to crash PHP and/or the web server running on an x86 architecture. III. Solution Apply a patch from your vendor Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory. As vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their comments. Please contact your vendor directly. Upgrade to the latest version of PHP If a patch is not available from your vendor, upgrade to version 4.2.2. Deny POST requests Until patches or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST requests. The following workaround is taken from the PHP Security Advisory: If the PHP applications on an affected web server do not rely on HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST requests on the web server. In the Apache web server, for example, this is possible with the following code included in the main configuration file or a top-level .htaccess file: Order deny,allow Deny from all Note that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have parameters contradicting the example given above. Disable vulnerable service Until you can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP. As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully consider your service requirements. Appendix A. - Vendor Information This appendix contains information provided by vendors for this advisory. As vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their comments. Apple Computer Inc. Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server are shipping with PHP version 4.1.2 which does not contain the vulnerability described in this alert. Caldera Caldera OpenLinux does not provide either vulnerable version (4.2.0, 4.2.1) of PHP in their products. Therefore, Caldera products are not vulnerable to this issue. Compaq Computer Corporation SOURCE: Compaq Computer Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard Company HP Services Software Security Response Team x-ref: SSRT2300 php post requests At the time of writing this document, Compaq is currently investigating the potential impact to Compaq's released Operating System software products. As further information becomes available Compaq will provide notice of the availability of any necessary patches through standard security bulletin announcements and be available from your normal HP Services supportchannel. Cray Inc. Cray, Inc. does not supply PHP on any of its systems. Debian Debian GNU/Linux stable aka 3.0 is not vulnerable. Debian GNU/Linux testing is not vulnerable. Debian GNU/Linux unstable is vulnerable. The problem effects PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. Woody ships an older version of PHP (4.1.2), that doesn't contain the vulnerable function. FreeBSD FreeBSD does not include any version of PHP by default, and so is not vulnerable; however, the FreeBSD Ports Collection does contain the PHP4 package. Updates to the PHP4 package are in progress and a corrected package will be available in the near future. Guardian Digital Guardian Digital has not shipped PHP 4.2.x in any versions of EnGarde, therefore we are not believed to be vulnerable at this time. Hewlett-Packard Company SOURCE: Hewlett-Packard Company Security Response Team At the time of writing this document, Hewlett Packard is currently investigating the potential impact to HP's released Operating System software products. As further information becomes available HP will provide notice of the availability of any necessary patches through standard security bulletin announcements and be available from your normal HP Services support channel. IBM IBM is not vulnerable to the above vulnerabilities in PHP. We do supply the PHP packages for AIX through the AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications. However, these packages are at 4.0.6 and also incorporate the security patch from 2/27/2002. Mandrakesoft Mandrake Linux does not ship with PHP version 4.2.x and as such is not vulnerable. The Mandrake Linux cooker does currently contain PHP 4.2.1 and will be updated shortly, but cooker should not be used in a production environment and no advisory will be issued. Microsoft Corporation Microsoft products are not affected by the issues detailed in this advisory. Network Appliance No Netapp products are vulnerable to this. Red Hat Inc. None of our commercial releases ship with vulnerable versions of PHP (4.2.0, 4.2.1). SuSE Inc. SuSE Linux is not vulnerable to this problem, as we do not ship PHP 4.2.x. _________________________________________________________________ The CERT/CC acknowledges e-matters GmbH for discovering and reporting this vulnerability. _________________________________________________________________ Author: Ian A.

spam,"your helpDEAR SIR, I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likewise developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of thirty six million United States Dollars (US$36,000,000) in cash, which I intend to use for investment purposes specifically in your country. This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian firm on our country's Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The Russian partners returned my husbands share of US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with my late husband's security company in Nigeria of which I am a director. Right now the new civilian government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial resources and they have revoked our licenses that allows us to own a financial and oil company. In view of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and deposited it in a privately erected security safe abroad. No record ever existed concerning the money neither is the money traceable by the Government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russians. Due to the current situation in the country concerning Government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this money into your safe bank account. On your consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss details of this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 20% of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. Your urgent response is highly needed so as to stop further contacts. all correspondent should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con or you can call my son mobile:hamza 234-8023137978 I use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the most utmost indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential what ever your decision while I await your prompt response.

ham,"Cannot stop XDM serviceFrom nobody Mon Mar 5 10:42:13 2018 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 First of all, I am very new to Linux but am well aware of the need to learn. After considerable googling with my issue, I gave up and thought I'd try a mailing list instead :) In attempting to install the cvm package (apt-get install cvm), I recieve a warning indicating that the XDM service cannot be automatically stopped/started and that I should do so manually. I then use rcconf to remove the little dot-selector-thingy beside XDM, which, as far as I understand, should stop the service immediately, but errors ensue in the rest of the installation and when I continue the installation again (apt-get -f install) I recieve the same warning that XDM is running and needs to be stopped manually. Checking in rcconf, the service is already unselected. Taking a hint from my background with MS Windows, I restarted the computer and tried the installation again; same warning and rcconf still shows the service as unselected. What am I not understanding here? Thanks in advance! Tom Schlodder - Calgary, Alberta, Canada "

Hi Vipul, I reckon if the ""unwritable log file"" error condition could be caught by Razor and handled gracefully (logging to syslog or /dev/null), it'd be a great help. As it stands, if the log file is unwritable, the razor check falls over entirely as the constructor returns undef (unblessed reference = 'die' error in perl). --j. ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Razor-users mailing list Razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users "

Robert Harley: >It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, >precisely identical between males and females. Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations. But that obscures the different modes of promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense of the word. But their motives and behavior are quite different. Langur monkeys were the example in the cited article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But cozying up to the current dominant male isn't the best strategy for female langurs, because ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide,"" by the male who is likely next to rule the roost. Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a better picture of that. ;-) _________________________________________________________________ Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com "

I've tried the following: 1. I have no "".xsession-errors"" (or "".xession-errors"") in my home directory or that of any other user. 2. It appears the configuration files for kde4 are found under ""/usr/share/kde4/config"" and also ""/etc/kde4/kdm/"". I tried moving the ""config"" directory to an obscure location and the doing the ""apt-get install --reinstall kdm"". It regenerated the config directory but no change in login. 3. I found that under /user/bin (when doing the dpkg -L kdm) there is a file ""genkdmconf"" which looked promising. Reading the help file for it and executing ""genkdmconf -no-old"", the files under /etc/kde4/kdm were backed up and new ones regenerated. Now, I get a different login screen background, but the action is still the same -- does not accept my password. I can still use the ""console login"" option of that screen and get to the CLI login and doing so still allows me to startx and get things going. So it appears that your last paragraph applies. I'll be glad to try (almost) anything you or anyone else suggests on this. (I am also, per my previous message, starting another thread for the symbol not found problem I have in trying to get some applications running (synaptic, iceape, geany to name a few).)

""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent shareholders from acting in their own interest."" ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in self-interest, but in self-destruction. ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers, existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us."" ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,"" said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding, regulations and making the market truly free."" ### ### ### Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for interviews on this topic.

That, in no way, means that (long) cannot be larger than (void*). That said, I do believe that the intent is that all of the standard integer types can be assumed to be zero when returned from a message sent to nil, even if the wording leaves the potential for a gap on unusual architectures (such as where long is larger than void*). --=20 Clark S.

Red Hat 8.0 ships with the bytecode hinter enabled; I think 7.3 may have as well. The enabling change to ""ftoption.h"" is made by Red Hat's SRPM before building. Take a look at ""freetype-2.1.1-enable-ft2-bci.patch"" from the SRPM; it's pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done.

Hi Goran, I just posted a followup with my complaint on the mc user list: http://mail.gnome.org/archives/mc/2010-April/msg00024.html It's not that simple as I mention there: when you change that default option all the directory entries turn bright white and in mcedit the entries turn black on white with a blue background which looks ridiculous. The problem is that they changed a major function without fallback and without a spectrum of options. Too bad but it's waiting until skins get developed or pinning mc to prevent 4.7.0.1 from installing.

(If you don't use RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry.) New in this version: RDF library abstraction (because rdflib's organization currently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with that old TRAMP flavor you've come to know and love. _But wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] if you're not already convinced. RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? * TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems!* Enjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called TRAMP.

If you are using AWT, you need to give your program access to the console. Apple uses a Mach-involved security model of namespaces to control access to various things; you can find more information on it at http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html. Worth reading. Several times. But the pertinent bit is ``A process can only use the global window server service if its EUID is 0 (it's running as root) or matches the UID of the console user. All other users are barred from using it.'' I don't see an update of this document for 10.6, either. > How can I set up things so that graphics generation proceeds and makes > image files as if graphics hardware were available?

You could try installing another Java that includes a client Xlib implementation, and go from there.

ham,"RE: The Curse of India's Socialism > You have multiple generations of > peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a > human parts of the property package. When I'd read that ""getting legal title can take 20 years"", when I believe that 1 year ought to be more than sufficient, (and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd assumed that we were talking about the urban poor. If I see people living in mansions, or even in suburban subdivisions, I assume they didn't have too much trouble with their titles. If I see people living in shanties and haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume their parcels weren't exactly recorded on the government maps, or paid for with a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant lots have shotgun wielding men presumably intent on keeping them ""development"" free. Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view of America"" to say that outside of Metro Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or two (Cebu?), everything else (literally) is the boondocks. But going on that very broad assumption, I guess I'm describing the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience: the paisanos (who leave behind those who remain on a patron's rural land) move to Manila, and (the second assumption) squat in shantytowns there, at least until they can line up a middle-class job. So, going on two large assumptions, I can come up with a scenario under which title would take 20 years: a shantytown arises somewhere in the midst of a section (or whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the land) and it takes decades of arguing to put together a package which somehow can both compensate the owner and record lots for the inhabitants. Just transferring title to an existing lot, between parties who have money, ought not to be a problem. The obvious solution, at least to us barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is to ""introduce market mechanisms"". It is left as an exercise to come up with one which works when many of the agents (are perceived to) have negligible NPV. -Dave > [land reform] meant that all the agricultural producers had > to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) ...

True, but that's the thinking of today, that the company mailserver can be closed to you from the outside; because as it is today you can use any mail- server that you've got access to.

A simple RFC could fix that today, either using a new header or extending the Received-header with a code/value that the server later on can verify; maybe something like this: Received2: Date: [date]; 	Local: sub.dom2.tld (IP#2); 	Remote: sub.dom3.tld (IP#3); 	Env-id: 	Code: [cache#, salted hashvalue, rsa or other signature] And then you have the two optional From and To, only added by the sending server that's identified the local sender or the server accepting mail for a certain user (to verify that it did really come via that server, in case you forward it using procmail or something like it). You of course would need some standard for how to check these headers. Not perfect, but better than what we have today. 	/Tony -- # Per scientiam ad libertatem! // Through knowledge towards freedom! # # Genom kunskap mot frihet! =*= (c) 1999-2002 tony@svanstrom.com =*= # perl -e'print$_{$_} for sort%_=`lynx -source svanstrom.com/t`' ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk "

That's because ""aptitude search"" implicitly puts an ?or between its parameters. Around them. Whatever. If you quote the arguments so they end up in a single command-line parameter, this should work. On the surface, this behavior is dumb. On the other hand, if an implicit ?and was used, ""aptitude search gnome kde"" would return only packages matching *both* gnome and kde, which probably isn't what the user wanted. Trade-offs in both directions; the one aptitude picked means that if you want to use complex patterns, you need to be aware of where your command-line arguments are.

It is on a fast moving target, and especially in the case of a major release. Many improvements are rolled into the recent 6.x release. If Debian isn't going to keep up with the current trunk; then there really is no point in packaging it here. As it stands I'm not going to go backwards a full version, so I have reverted to the PPA builds.

I assume that how much the trust goes down depends of the proportion of report vs revoke. If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the one guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the majority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your trust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither against the majority nor with it, so your trust won't change.

I found a few posts with the same error > during the last, but > no answer so far. > > > IMO complaints should go to bugs.debian.org, > > not necessarily here. > > Noted. > > Th. In Thomas' defense, I noticed the same thing and had much the same reaction. The Squeeze KDE 4.4 update this week pulled down network-manager as a dependency. In my case I much prefer wicd to handle my wireless. The update had them both running simultaneously, which I didn't like at all. I was plugged into my wired network, which wicd had set up as default, and network-manger connected to one of the wireless networks I had configured. Both interfaces up, even two default routes. Yuk. I didn't like the fact that the KDE update ignored my current install of wicd to install network-manager, and when I purged network-manager KDE worked (and continues to work) just fine. So the ""dependency"" on network-manager seems to be merely a preference of the KDE team. To me that means I should not have seen network-manager if I already had wicd installed. This is very similar to the various packages that insist they need avahi-daemon to work, and yet purging avahi-daemon doesn't break anything not using mDNS. So while Thomas could file a bug, I don't think it's not germane to complain about DDs putting everything under the sun into a dependency list. Here's the place for the community to decide whether we really need to force an install of network-manager (or avahi) when they're not really needed, or decide that because some cases might require it everyone should have it. Anyway, just my 2c James ------------------------------------ Only time I have incurred this is when I have preferences set to include ""recommended"" files as ""dependencies"" thereby passing control of the upgrade to the system.

As I stated, a for profit organization is out there to make money. That's it's goal. User Groups are designed to bring people together. When looking at ""what's good for the members"" and ""what makes money"", a for profit venture would decide on money. While I'm sure it wouldn't do something ""bad"" to it's members, ultimately by it's definition it has to make a profit. Nothing wrong with for profit ventures, but to have someone volunteer in a for profit venture isn't really volunteering. It's giving of your time to make someone else money.

I simply can't imagine a scenario where the ancient discs of the month and printed newsletters make sense.

I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything specific on this scenario. Here's the situation. I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log) At the end of this file, I use :0fw | spamc to call spamassassin. Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do for our corporate masters) (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made.

The result, to put it succinctly, is ""nothing"". No forwards go out, no files are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun example above) and still nothing. However, I can redirect those other messages. In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- other users have no problems.

ham,"Daniel Berlinger has noticed that Mac software shops are starting to move tURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html Date: Not supplied Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _ over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same amount of money. Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that magic 25 multiplier.

No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time. Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove requests have in the entire past year. One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain. I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the same box).

Both Yahoo and Mapquest have aerial photos available, down to fairly decent resolution in most areas. I can clearly pick out my house on a 60'x120' lot using it. It may be adequate for your purposes. And in public places, such as the capitol building, I can pick out individual people, though I obviously can't tell who they are. Try, for example, http://www.mapquest.com/ To see actual photographs, click on ""Aerial map"" in the upper right hand corner.

Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the situation. There's good design and bad design. There's good testing and bad testing. The problem is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody does. I think ""best practices"" hasn't caught up on main street Web enablement yet. There's some really great packages on how to do this stuff and in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms and XHTML. You can shoot yourself in the foot and people usually do. What the problem is, they don't even recognize that they're gimpy--ever. They just keeping trundling along making a mess of everything assured in their job security that they can build Web forms without even caring if they can be used or not beyond their test machine. If you had a piece of software and a security warning came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software? Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally broken 4 years and 11 months ago? What I want to know is why would someone use Web forms best practices from 5 years ago? I mean you can get a college degree in that time. Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window manager? Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for a brief period of time, but they are completely useless except for some terminal based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can't get across the bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault it really is, and it's the business that needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

ham,"Battery monitor tools? I'm looking for a good battery charge/discharge profiler tool for my=20 Ubuntu laptop. I'm aware that there's the ""Power History"" tool, but it=20 doesn't seem to do what I'm after. I'll explain.... A couple of years ago, I came across a really neat tool for Windows for=20 estimating the time remaining until the battery is completely charged or = discharged. It was pretty clever about how it went about it. It would=20 constantly record things like: how much charge the battery said it still = had, how much the battery said it was charging/discharging at, etc. The=20 tool would use this info to estimate the time to charge/discharge...=20 /but/ it also went one step further. It could account for errors in the=20 battery's reporting. For example, if the battery reported that it had=20 80% charge left, and then, a few minutes later, reported that it had=20 just 20% left, then this tool would learn this, and realize that the=20 battery was old/problematic. So, the /next/ time the battery was=20 reporting 80% charge left, the tool would know not to give too=20 optimistic of an estimate for the remaining time. In other words, the=20 tool was learning what ""80%"" /really/ meant to that battery. It also did something else which was really cool. Because the battery=20 drains at different rates depending upon what you're doing with your=20 laptop (ie, playing a DVD on a bright screen versus just reading some=20 text on a dimmer screen), this tool would actually show you ""best case""=20 and ""worst case"" predictions of your remaining battery life (or time to=20 charge back up) based upon /actual/ discharge rates from /that level/ of = battery charge remaining that it had experienced on /that/ laptop. So,=20 you'd open up the little power-discharge graph tool and you'd see three=20 lines: a best, a worst, and one in-between which was what rate you're=20 currently at. So, two questions: 1 - Does anyone know what tool that was? (Yes, I know this is a Linux=20 forum but, as long as I'm describing the tool, I figured I'd ask. It's=20 not the PassMark one. I thought it was called BatMon or something, but=20 now I can't find it anywhere). 2 - Does anybody know of a tool that does this in Linux? Or, is there=20 some way to get the Gnome power-history tool to show this kind of stuff? - Joe -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

This only restates the assertion, it doesn't clarify /how/ government restrains you, other than under laws of criminal conduct and violent crimes (if you meant the above literally) If I can trace a spammer to their ISP, I can /generally/ get that account revoked, and if you trace one to their parent corporation, I don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits, it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way. If you have some law that prevents action against spammers, then why all the class-action suits and other anti-spam court cases, some even state-funded? I'm also curious of the mechanics of your retribution strategy: Let's say you did win a lawsuit and shut down the largest spammer network in the USA, do you really believe 40 Beijing spammers won't fill the void? Do you really believe those 40 are not right now prepping their mail servers whether or not you prevail over your countrymen? How do you intend to take legal (and/or violent) action against people a world away and in a culture you can barely understand let alone understand how to properly bribe? I'm not so hopeful this method can work against aromatherapy viagra when we can't even track and convict murderous Nigerian mafia, and they are blatant!

In your smb.conf: 2.a The following are missing (although they may be the default settings for these variables): security =3D user local master =3D yes 2.b I have forgotten why, but AFAIK ""127.0.0.1"" should be listed in ""interfaces =3D"". 2.c What does ""share modes =3D No"" do? 3. If you have not yet created a computer account for the Windows box, you have to log on to the domain as root (or as a user with the right to add a machine account) the first time that you do so from a Samba client for the ""add machine script =3D"" variable to do its magic. 4. The ""_ldap._tcp...."" DNS SRV records are needed for an AD domain (IIRC there are 6 +-1). I have never set up an AD Samba PDC but your smb.conf settings look like those of an NT4 Samba PDC so it may just be a misleading error/failure message. Your Windows box seems to be an XP VM but just in case the netbios name is misleading, see http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Windows7 -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

Now with my laptop running Linux Mint 8 the version of Wicd in the archive (1.6.1-3ubuntu) has a real heartache going from one of my WPA networks to the other WPA network by getting into a state where it says ""no wireless networks found"" and only a reboot seems to clear it (I was too lazy/rushed to try various things like reloading the kernel driver, etc.) I've now given Network Manager a try again and It Just Works (TM) and lets me roam from one network to the other through suspend seemlessly. Tong, if your laptop has an Atheros based card (AR5212 chipset) it will use the ath5k driver which works very very well. I've been using an Atheros based card and the laptops I've had have been Atheros based for several years. It's probably the best supported chipset out there. Once you enjoy the freedom of movement that wireless offers, you'll wonder why you didn't try it sooner. Feel free trying to kill time setting up the low level tools manually. I suggest that if you're running one of the desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) then you'll be better served just using Network Manager or Wicd as both are easy to use and make dealing with multiple wireless networks very easy. - Nate >> -- ""The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds.

Pity the world, or else this glutton be, To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Shakespeare, William. Sonnets. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet, dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway. He enjoyed quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the King's Men). He retired in 1610, having spent a successful career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants alike. Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will probably never know). Among the rumors and hypotheses offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer; illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet (in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with political ties). Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind and heart of the playwright. Published in 1609, the 154 sonnets involve the author's relationship with various characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious woman, and a rival poet. The identities of the characters have also been the subject of much speculation over the years, despite the fact that they may have been completely created in the mind of the bard. -------------------------------------------------------------------- By Mickie Kennedy of http://www.poetrypreviews.com Copyright DayTips.com, Inc., 2002.

Your response comes the closest so far to what I'm looking > for. Based on what I know from other programming languages, I don't think > it's going to be necessary to explicitly declare a union. It's possible, but I would generally do it for clarity. I like using the=20 types of variables/arguments as documentation, so I would store any data wh= ere=20 the real type was unknown in the union. Then access it though a ""struct=20 cms_label *"" or ""struct volume_label *"" one I had determined the correct ty= pe. Since C unions are not tagged, a C union is the same size as it's largest=20 member. (NB: Not really sure how __attribute__((__packed__)) changes thing= s,=20 if at all; it's possible you need it on the union to prevent padding from=20 being added after the space occupied by the largest member.) > In short, I need to (a) declare ""cms_label"" as a based structure, (above; timmmed) > (b) > declare a pointer variable called ""cms_ptr"" and associate it with the > ""cms_label"" structure, struct cms_label *cms_ptr; Initialization optional, but recommended. > (c) make sure that the compiler does not attempt > to allocate any storage for the ""cms_label"" structure, Since you are declaring a pointer to a structure, and not declaring an obje= ct=20 with type ""struct cms_label"", no space will be allocated for a cms_label. > (d) make sure that > the compiler automatically acquires storage for the ""cms_ptr"" pointer > variable itself, Make your declaration a definition and that'll be handled.

spam,"Dish Networks best offer of the year and save over $550 Yet he read much about the war. Some of the recounted episodes deeply and ineffaceably impressed him. For example, an American newspaper correspondent had written a dramatic description of the German army marching, marching steadily along a great Belgian high road--a procession without beginning and without end--and of the procession being halted for his benefit, and of a German officer therein who struck a soldier several times in the face angrily with his cane, while the man stood stiffly at attention. George had an ardent desire to spend a few minutes alone with that officer; he could not get the soldier's bruised cheek out of his memory. Good-evening once more, Miss Nowell, he said. I _might_, you knaoo! said Marrier, brightening to full hope in the fraction of a second.General, the Chouans have no doubt brought arms for those escaped recruits. Now, if we try to outmarch them, they will catch us in the woods and shoot every one of us before we can get to Ernee. We must argue, as you call it, with cartridges. During the skirmish, which will last more time than you think for, some of us ought to go back and fetch the National Guard and the militia from Fougeres. What could it all mean? Why that medium for her message? Should he write and ask her? But what was there to ask or say, in the face of her silence? Besides, he had not even her address. Miss Camilla could doubtless give him that. But would she? How much did she understand? Why had she turned so unhelpful? .She wouldn't see him. She's very strong-willed.... That's a wonderful woman, hibody Io's voice shook a little. We can't stop their tongues, he said at last. Ah! I did a foolish thing! She turned upon him the sparkle of golden lights in wine-brown eyes. It's a fairy bower. I'm going to do a bewitchment. What makes you think it was Colonel de Peyster or any other English or Tory officer who saved me from the Indians? Well, it wasn't. If Colonel Bird and your other white friends had had their way when I was taken I should have been burned at the stake long before this. It was the Wyandot chief, Timmendiquas, known in our language as White Lightning, who saved me. I beg your pardon, the stranger said, addressing him in pure and limpid English, which sounded to Philip like the dialect of the very best circles, yet with some nameless difference of intonation or accent which certainly was not foreign, still less provincial, or Scotch, or Irish; it seemed rather like the very purest well of English undefiled Philip had ever heard,--only, if anything, a little more so; I beg your pardon, but I'm a stranger hereabouts, and I should be so VERY much obliged if you could kindly direct me to any good lodgings. Yes, said she. The landlady wanted the money, she told me. So Nellie gave me her share, and I paid it at once. $300+ Data Entry from Home He belonged to that small minority of undemonstrative retiring natures, who are always at peace with themselves, and who are conscious of a feeling of humiliation at the mere thought of making a request, no matter what its nature may be. So promotion had come to him tardily, and by virtue of the slowly-working laws of seniority. He had been made a sub-lieutenant in 1802, but it was not until 1829 that he became a major, in spite of the grayness of his moustaches. His life had been so blameless that no man in the army, not even the general himself, could approach him without an involuntary feeling of respect. It is possible that he was not forgiven for this indisputable superiority by those who ranked above him; but, on the other hand, there was not one of his men that did not feel for him something of the affection of children for a good mother. For them he knew how to be at once indulgent and severe. He himself had also once served in the ranks, and knew the sorry joys and gaily-endured hardships of the soldier's lot. He knew the errors that may be passed over and the faults that must be punished in his men--his children, as he always called them--and when on campaign he readily gave them leave to forage for provision for man and horse among the wealthier classes. Master Pillsbury pursed his lips and his expression became severe. Yes, I shall outlive it, else I should have little faith in myself. But I shall not forget; and if you would remain forever what you now are to me, you will so act that nothing may mar this memory, if it is to be no more. I doubt your power to forget an affection which has survived so many changes and withstood assaults such as Geoffrey must unconsciously have made upon it. But I have no right to condemn your beliefs, to order your actions, or force you to accept my code of morals if you are not ready for it. You must decide, but do not again deceive yourself, and through whatever comes hold fast to that which is better worth preserving than husband, happiness, or friend. What's the price, asked Ellis, of the cigar and the compliment together? In other words, what do you want of me? A boat? Lord, that sounds good! sighed Banneker. 'Brian is not unkind to you, I hope?' cried Bessie, prepared to be indignant. by a new destroyer--a gentlemanly vulture, whose suave accents and perfect manners were fatal to the unwary. Henceforth Horatio Cromie Nugent Paget flourished and fattened upon the folly of his fellow-men. As promoter of joint-stock companies that never saw the light; as treasurer of loan-offices where money was never lent; as a gentleman with capital about to introduce a novel article of manufacture from the sale of which a profit of five thousand a year would infallibly be realized, and desirous to meet with another gentleman of equal capital; as the mysterious X.Y.Z. who will--for so small a recompense as thirty postage-stamps--impart the secret of an elegant and pleasing employment, whereby seven-pound-ten a-week may be made by any individual, male or female;--under every flimsy disguise with which the swindler hides his execrable form, Captain Paget plied his cruel trade, and still contrived to find fresh dupes. Of course there were occasions when the pigeons were slow to flutter into the fascinating snare, and when the vulture had a bad time of it; and it was a common thing for the Captain to sink from the splendour of Mayfair or St. James's-street into some dingy transpontine hiding-place. But he never went back to Tulliver's-terrace, though Mary Anne pleaded piteously for the payment of her poor mother's debt. When her husband was in funds, he patted her head affectionately, and told her that he would see about it--i.e. the payment of Mrs. Kepp's bill; while, if she ventured to mention the subject to him when his purse was scantily furnished, he would ask her fiercely how he was to satisfy her mother's extortionate claims when he had not so much as a sixpence for his own use.

This prevents leaking relay 	relay spam. You must use the new hackmc script to install this 	change in sendmail.cf. remove ""# whitelisted"" from `cdcc stats` output to give more room 	for totals. prevent empty dccproc log files as noted by Krzysztof Snopek. even fatal errors should cause dccproc to exit with 0 to avoid 	rejecting mail, as noted by Krzysztof Snopek. When server hostnames have common IP addresses, prefer the server 	with the non-anonymous client-ID, noted by Krzysztof Snopek.

ham," Two New AmphetaDesk Hacks URL: 4538e94b3b2c6b19041756b37b1f9916 Date: Not supplied Since the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.

Fact: the C standard does not say anything about machine-level calling conventions. Fact: the C standard does not address the behavior which results when the call site of a function sees a prototype whose return type differs from the return type present at the definition of the function. Conclusion: a conforming C compiler could use completely different techniques for returning 'int' and 'long'. Conclusion: in such an ABI, machine-level code which arranges for callers to see an 'int' return value of 0 could easily be written such that a caller which expects 'long' to see something other than zero. Conclusion: if you're paranoid about portability, you can't assume that messages to nil with a 'long' return type will return 0, with a strict reading of Apple's guarantees. And note that absolutely nothing in the above is even slightly related to integer type sizes, type conversions, casts, promotions, the bit-level representation of the NULL pointer, or any other such things, so any discussion of them in this context is utterly pointless.

ham,"Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sNormally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated with fairly good ideas. Just a big turnoff. A good example would be the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc. (This was one of the many topics I obsessively absorbed as a teenager.) Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / G-Force Dyno-Staff. I have to say however that, having found this while looking for something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms. I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction. Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc. To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize. Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models. I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and justify US/UN foreign policy and actions. http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/ (Apologies for the embedded HTML.) We create the world we live in. A loving person lives in a loving world, A hostile person lives in a hostile world. Everyone you meet is your mirror. You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have. The past is dead, The future is imaginary, Happiness can only be in the Eternal Now Moment How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have. Love a person because he or she is there. This is the only reason. Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.

Just saying ""crucial hair feature"" improves my day immeasurably. I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting thing. It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered. One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same. Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial. I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for getting to know. I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance. Interesting isn't an external thing. I have that brought home to me again every so often. I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, but that's total superstition. How do I know what your version of creative attire is? Maybe it's purely functional. I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm. I was working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness."" I flinched from that, rather violently. At a trade show, or something, I might elect to talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits. At a party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if on the net all you have is a photo..... You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words. It's not how we are built. There's no geek code for the heart and soul. (And if there were people would lie and game the system.) It's too easy to say ""Oh, no! He's a geek!"" or ""She's a CAT person, ick!"" when you might have a great time together. We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on tasks and recreation. This is all entirely speculative based on nothing but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the person's company. Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of exposure shrinks after school. Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it doesn't. I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the same poor results. I have to think it's not the people, but the tool. An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek): Speed Dating Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event. I think it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever. It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young people to avoid total assimilation. It has too much ""interview"" context and no shared activity beyond that. I give it several points for effort though. I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is actually sound. Eirikur "

Slashdot, of course, links to them. So now, I link to slashdot. http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123 I find this all incredibly funny really. Congress _and_ the courts relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are applied. For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).

ham,"liberal defnitionsDepends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over regulation. The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly. Rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing. As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics. Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better than government regulation itself. And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a watermelon. > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Geege > Schuman > > funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally > irresponsible. which do you think is the worse indictment - > overregulation > or overspending? there are many (dickheads) who buy into the > neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of ""liberal"" as ""one who seeks > to > impose both.""

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with cygwin1.dll. The .exes are cmdline programs. One is a POP3 proxy. If I currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy. In that way the proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader tells it the user name is. This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and ""all it does"" is insert a X-Text-Classification: one_of_the_class_names_you_picked header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader. The user then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and ""do something about it"" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much ).

Well, that makes the image slightly smaller, but I still get a blank page between every printed page. Further testing leads me to believe that this problem is driver-specific. When I print to another printer, an IBM Proprinter II, I do not have this problem. I see that in Lenny the ghostscript pj driver is used and in Squeeze they have switched to the hplis driver. Perhaps upgrading to Squeeze may fix the problem. In the meantime, I'm going to do some experimenting with the ghostscript driver directly and see what I can see. --=20 .''`.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components, replcomps, forwcomps and so on). That way you get them when you are editing your message. Also, by using comps files for specific folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks). See the docs for (n)mh for all the details. There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now. I load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg, to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).

Please sign up as a member today! *Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution of the software does not violate copyright law. Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol. In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck, Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software. Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new opportunities for artists. On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW). Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

The festival will be held in Golden Gate Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon - 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia. Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters, celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady. In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus, Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends! Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros. Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual technologies. The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to help artists share music more directly with their fans, without sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages artists to share with one another and their fans Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves. The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.

The restrictive law regarding audio is actually the accumulated cruft of 30 years of various legislative acts. The totality of what we have now come from various parts of all the following re: sound recordings: 1998 - DMCA 1995 - Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act 1992 - Audio Home Recording Act 1976 - Copyright Act amendment 1972 - Copyright Act amendment It is worth noting that many people have forgotten about the 1976 Copyright Act Amendment which created the foundational law stating that the copyright owners have the right to limit personal use of audio recordings after First Sale even if you are not ""making copies"" in any commercial sense. Sound recordings, for many intents and purposes, are explicitly excluded from Fair Use by the 1976 amendment. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com "

Aside from the quality issue, two+ years ago there was considerable internet chatter about BIOSes on some Foxconn models that were unfriendly to Linux. According to the Foxconn article in the Wikipedia Foxconn was forced by some of the companies which used Foxconn boards in their own brands to fix those BIOSes. In any event if the information in that article is even half true, Foxconn is a manufacturer to avoid. > Intel chipsets make sense for Intel Motherboards, the days when you > needed to look to Via or someone else to provide the needed features > are mostly gone (Nvidia is, for now, still the best for more powerful > integrated graphics with Intel CPUs.

The model I was originally looking at was a GA-G31M-ES2L for CA$59.00. I found however a GA-EP43-UD3L with the ICH10 and many other more advanced features including better Realtek audio for CA$83.00. As I am using an external GPU which GPU internal chipset is provided is not really an issue for me. I think the latter model is better value for the price.

Ditto. > But it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any > MIME structure or HTML parts, and several messages in my saved 'zope > geeks' list that happened to be using MIME and/or HTML. Do you know why? The strangest implied claim there is that it hates MIME independent of HTML. For example, the spamprob of 'content-type:text/plain' in that pickle is under 0.21. 'content-type:multipart/alternative' gets 0.93, but that's not a killer clue, and one bit of good content will more than cancel it out. WRT hating HTML, possibilities include: 1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML. 2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part), so that the tags aren't getting stripped. The pickled classifier despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage. 3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the latter doesn't contain the same text as the text/html part (for example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just says something like ""This is an HMTL message.""). If it's #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize() meaning ""even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway"". In fact, I'd like to do that and default it to True. The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists strikes me as, umm, extreme . > So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-). That would be a different experiment.

As far as I can figure out the applet provided by package sun-java6-bin is update 12. - From the Sun Microsystems site I downloaded file jre-6u19-i586.bin; moved it to directory /usr/lib/jvm, changed ownership to root:root and permissions to rwxr-xr-x and ran the binary. It created a new directory /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.6.0_19 and opened in that directory a number of subdirectories and files. Next, I needed to add this new JRE to /etc/alternatives. Using the alternatives configurator provided by package galternatives, as root I selected 'java' as the alternative to configure and added to the options list /usr/lib/jvm/1.6.0_19/bin/java and finally selected this new option. After reloading Iceweasel, about:plugins still showed the previous JRE I was using, /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java. Assuming that I can use a later version of JRE downloaded from Sun on Iceweasel 3.5, am I on the right track but did not get the newer version set up correctly, or is there a different way?

Here you'll get tips on using core Java technologies and APIs, such as those in Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE TM ). Using ArrayList and LinkedList Using Zero-Length Arrays These tips were developed using Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4. This issue of the JDC Tech Tips is written by Glen McCluskey. USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST ArrayList and LinkedList are two Collections classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an ArrayList of Strings, or a LinkedList of Integers. This tip compares the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList , and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation. The first key point is that an ArrayList is backed by a primitive Object array. Because of that, an ArrayList is much faster than a LinkedList for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the get method. Note that the get method is implemented for LinkedLists , but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a LinkedList , there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list. Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an ArrayList or a LinkedList . Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound. Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an ArrayList or a LinkedList : import java.util.*; public class ListDemo1 { static final int N = 10000; static List values; // make List of increasing Integer values static { Integer vals[] = new Integer[N]; Random rn = new Random(); for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { vals[i] = new Integer(currval); currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1; } values = Arrays.asList(vals); } // iterate across a list and look up every // value in the list using binary search static long timeList(List lst) { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { // look up a value in the list // using binary search int indx = Collections.binarySearch( lst, values.get(i)); // sanity check for result // of binary search if (indx != i) { System.out.println( &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;); } } return System.currentTimeMillis() - start; } public static void main(String args[]) { // do lookups in an ArrayList System.out.println(&quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; + timeList(new ArrayList(values))); // do lookups in a LinkedList System.out.println( &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; + timeList(new LinkedList(values))); } } The ListDemo1 program sets up a List of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an ArrayList or a LinkedList . Then Collections.binarySearch is used to search for each value in the list. When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this: time for ArrayList = 31 time for LinkedList = 4640 ArrayList is about 150 times faster than LinkedList . (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for ArrayList as compared to that for LinkedList . The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly, LinkedList is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and LinkedList does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a LinkedList is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an ArrayList has a fixed time. You can use the RandomAccess marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access: void f(List lst) { if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) { // supports fast random access } } ArrayList implements the RandomAccess interface, and LinkedList . does not. Note that Collections.binarySearch does take advantage of the RandomAccess property, to optimize searches. Do these results prove that ArrayList is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where LinkedList does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for LinkedList . An example is reversing a LinkedList using Collections.reverse . The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators. Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case, LinkedList is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following &quot;worst case&quot; scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this: import java.util.*; public class ListDemo2 { static final int N = 50000; // time how long it takes to add // N objects to a list static long timeList(List lst) { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); Object obj = new Object(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { lst.add(0, obj); } return System.currentTimeMillis() - start; } public static void main(String args[]) { // do timing for ArrayList System.out.println( &quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; + timeList(new ArrayList())); // do timing for LinkedList System.out.println( &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; + timeList(new LinkedList())); } } When you run this program, the result should look something like this: time for ArrayList = 4859 time for LinkedList = 125 These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example. When an element is added to the beginning of an ArrayList , all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a LinkedList simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a LinkedList has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an ArrayList has a cost that's proportional to the list size. So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how ArrayList and LinkedList are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally. The LinkedList class has a private internal class defined like this: private static class Entry { Object element; Entry next; Entry previous; } Each Entry object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the LinkedList -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A LinkedList of 1000 elements will have 1000 Entry objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a LinkedList structure, given all these Entry objects. An ArrayList has a backing Object array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as: newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1; Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an ArrayList with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way ArrayList works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space. If you know how many elements will be in an ArrayList , you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the trimToSize method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space. So far, this discussion has assumed that either an ArrayList or a LinkedList is &quot;right&quot; for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key. You could store the pairs in an N x 2 Object array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists. Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of ArrayLists , and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a HashMap . Which is faster, a binary search on an ArrayList , or a HashMap ? Here's a final example that compares these two: import java.util.*; public class ListDemo3 { static final int N = 500000; // Lists of keys and values static List keys; static List values; // fill the keys list with ascending order key // values and fill the values list with // corresponding values (-key) static { Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N]; Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N]; Random rn = new Random(); for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval); valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval); currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1; } keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec); values = Arrays.asList(valuevec); } // fill a Map with key/value pairs static Map map = new HashMap(); static { for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i)); } } // do binary search lookup of all keys static long timeList() { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { int indx = Collections.binarySearch( keys, keys.get(i)); // sanity check of returned value // from binary search if (indx != i) { System.out.println( &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;); } } return System.currentTimeMillis() - start; } // do Map lookup of all keys static long timeMap() { long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { Integer value = (Integer)map.get( keys.get(i)); // sanity check of value returned // from map lookup if (value != values.get(i)) { System.out.println( &quot;*** error ***\n&quot;); } } return System.currentTimeMillis() - start; } public static void main(String args[]) { // do timing for List implementation System.out.println(""List time = "" + timeList()); // do timing for Map implementation System.out.println(&quot;Map time = &quot; + timeMap()); } } The program sets up Lists of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table. When you run the ListDemo3 program, you should get a result that looks something like this: ArrayList time = 1000 HashMap time = 281 In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the ArrayList will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case. However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs. Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip: Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both ArrayList and LinkedList. For ArrayList , appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For LinkedList , the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal Entry object. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an ArrayList implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a LinkedList has fixed cost. A LinkedList does not support efficient random access An ArrayList has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A LinkedList has significant space overhead per element. Sometimes a Map structure is a better choice than a List . For more information about Using ArrayList and LinkedLists , see section 16.6, List, and section 16.7, Map and SortedMap, in &quot; The Java TM Programming Language Third Edition &quot; by Arnold, Gosling, and Holmes. Also see the Collections trail in the Java Tutorial, Third Edition . back to top USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYS Suppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates &quot;outliers,&quot; that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data. How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach: import java.util.*; public class ZeroDemo1 { // filter input array and throw away values // that are less than minval or greater than // maxval static int[] filterData( int indata[], int minval, int maxval) { // check parameters for errors if (indata == null) { throw new NullPointerException( &quot;indata is null&quot;); } if (maxval &lt; minval) { throw new IllegalArgumentException( &quot;maxval &lt; minval&quot;); } // count number of valid values // in input array int validcnt = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) { if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] &lt;= maxval) { validcnt++; } } // if no valid values, return null if (validcnt == 0) { return null; } // copy valid values to new array // and return it int outdata[] = new int[validcnt]; for (int i = 0, j = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) { if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] &lt;= maxval) { outdata[j++] = indata[i]; } } return outdata; } public static void main(String args[]) { // set up test array of integers int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59}; // filter out values not in the range 1-10 int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10); for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata1.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata1[i]); } // filter out values not // in the range 100-200 int outdata2[] = filterData( indata, 100, 200); for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata2.length; i++) { System.out.println(outdata2[i]); } } } The filterData method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference. The result of running the ZeroDemo1 program is: 1 3 8 Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72) The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of filterData returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account. A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values: /* if (validcnt == 0) { return null; } */ When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated: int outdata[] = new int[0]; This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length. For the ZeroDemo1 example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this: int outdata[] = new int[validcnt]; if (validcnt == 0) { return outdata; } Note that usage such as: int outdata[] = new int[]{}; is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants. In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows: private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = new int[0]; This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application. There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example: import java.util.*; public class ZeroDemo2 { public static void main(String args[]) { // set up ArrayList and add strings to it List stringlist = new ArrayList(); stringlist.add(&quot;string 1&quot;); stringlist.add(&quot;string 2&quot;); stringlist.add(&quot;string 3&quot;); // convert to String array String out[] = ( String[])stringlist.toArray( new String[0]); for (int i = 0; i &lt; out.length; i++) { System.out.println(out[i]); } } } The result of running the ZeroDemo2 program is: string 1 string 2 string 3 The ZeroDemo2 program sets up an ArrayList , and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls toArray to get a String array of the three elements in the ArrayList . In this example, the argument to toArray is &quot;new String[0]&quot;. This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a String array that's big enough to hold the elements of the ArrayList , you can specify it as the argument to toArray . The method will use the String array. But if your array is not big enough, then the toArray method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. ArrayList stores its element references in an Object array. The toArray method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection ( java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance ) to create an array of the appropriate type.

This update incorporates all security updates which have been released for the oldstable release since the previous point release, with one exception which it was unfortunately not possible to include, together with a few adjustments to serious problems. PLEASE NOTE: Security support for the oldstable distribution ended in February 2010 [1] and no updates have been released since that point. 1: http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121 Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are included in this update. New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively will be available soon at the regular locations. Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors. A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at: Please note that the oldstable distribution will be moved from the main archive to the archive.debian.org repository after June 6th 2010. After this move, it will no longer be available from the main mirror network. More information about the distribution archive and a list of mirrors is available at: Miscellaneous Bugfixes ---------------------- This oldstable update adds a few important corrections to the following packages: Package Reason backup-manager Fix disclosure of MySQL passwords to local users binutils Add mips support for "".set symbol,value"" gas syntax fam Fix 100% CPU usage in famd fetchmail Fix potential MITM against APOP and potential DoS freedoom Remove copyright-violating material glibc Fix incorrect libc6-amd64 dependency gnupg Fix memory leak and cleanup terminal on interrupt irssi Fix out of bounds access kazehakase Disallow adding bookmarks for data:/javascript: URIs linux-2.6 Several vulnerabilities linux-2.6.24 Several vulnerabilities mksh Fix unauthenticated local privilege escalation mt-daapd Update the embedded prototype.js to fix security issues openafs Don't create invalid pointers to kernel memory when handling errors openssl Deprecate MD2 hash signatures and fix several DoS vulnerabilities serveez Fix remote buffer overflow tetex-bin Don't fail when LaTeX is more than five years old texlive-bin Don't fail when LaTeX is more than five years old texlive-extra Don't fail when LaTeX is more than five years old texlive-lang Don't fail when LaTeX is more than five years old wordpress Fix DoS via long title and specially constructed charset parameter xcftools Fix crash with files containing negative co-ordinates Debian Installer ---------------- The Debian Installer has been updated in this point release to offer better support for installation of the ""oldstable"" distribution and from archive.debian.org and to resolve issues with checking the GPG signatures of some files on mirror servers. The kernel image used by the installer has been updated to incorporate a number of important and security-related fixes. Security Updates ---------------- This revision adds the following security updates to the oldstable release.

possible to include the security updates for the lcms package in this point release due to a mismatch between the upstream tarball used for the security update and that already present in the

Removed packages ---------------- The following packages were removed due to circumstances beyond our control: Package Reason destar Security issues libclass-dbi-loader-relationship-perl License problems libhdate-pascal [source:hdate] Licensing issues loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc32 [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc64 [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc64-smp [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive loop-aes-modules-2.6-vserver-sparc64 [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive rails Security and usability issues A few further packages were removed as a result, as they depend on libclass-dbi-loader-relationship-perl; these packages are: maypole maypole-authentication-usersession-cookie maypole-plugin-upload memories Additionally those parts of the libwww-search-perl and libperl4caml-ocaml-dev packages which rely on the Google SOAP search API (provided by libnet-google-perl) are no longer functional as the API has been retired by Google. The remaining portions of the packages will continue to function as before.

Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down when you disagree with them. The people that do this are NOT disenfranchised. They get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes.

ham,"Re: Re[3]: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more partners than women. I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other men. http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html > As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the Band Played On. He writes about bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture. That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and bathhouse culture played in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that there was a cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community. Tom "

Or bug? If the latter, which package? I think that this is a bug, but I don't know where. I'm guessing that it has something to do with KMS in newer kernels. But that's just a guess. I do a lot of work in the text consoles. I often use an 80x50 video mode (via the VGA option of lilo), which generally works everywhere. Anyway, I was not happy with the fonts provided by console-setup; and I wanted to go back to the legacy fonts that are used by Lenny. I opened a thread on this forum about the problem (http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2009/12/msg01438.html) and got a satisfactory resolution. Here's what I would recommend that you try. First, make sure that the console-data package is installed. Then, in /etc/default/console-setup, set FONTFACE="""" FONTSIZE="""" Then add FONT=lat1u-16.psf.gz In my case, I use lat1u-08.psf.gz as the font, since the 80x50 video mode requires an eight-pixel-high font; but in your case, since you apparently use the traditional VGA boot-up hardware text mode (no framebuffer, I presume), you will need the sixteen-pixel-high font. Give that a whirl and see how it goes. This method gives a larger selection of fonts to choose from. (lat1u-16 is a suggestion, but there are other sixteen-pixel-high fonts you can choose from. See the /usr/share/consolefonts directory for a complete list.) And in my opinion, these fonts look better too. But most importantly, this method may circumvent the bug you are experiencing. If it does circumvent the bug, console-setup is the most suspect package. -- .''`.

When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to wonder who didn't get the memo.&#8221; The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text.

It also claims to provide kernel-sources at the same version.

All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM. > Obviously, you can't do this with partitions that accrue important > state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data. ... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a mountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of access control management to decide who can do what to the writable partition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers. Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it read-only: * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to reboot, at least. * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software have to reboot, at least.

The first line counts msgs that had 8 instances of a 'Received' header, and the second counts msgs that had 7 instances. I expect this is a good clue! The more indirect the mail path, the more of those thingies we'll see, and if you're posting from a spam trailer park in Tasmania you may well need to travel thru more machines. > ... > Note that header names are case insensitive, so this one's no > different than ""MIME-Version:"". Similarly other headers in your list. Ignoring case here may or may not help; that's for experiment to decide. It's plausible that case is significant, if, e.g., a particular spam mailing package generates unusual case, or a particular clueless spammer misconfigures his package. > 0.02 65 3559 'header:Precedence:1' > > Could be Mailman, or not.

Rule of thumb: if Mailman inserts a thing, I should ignore it.

The brilliance of Anthony's ""just count them"" scheme is that it requires no thought, so can't be fooled . Header lines that are evenly distributed across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indicators (prob near 0.5), so do no harm. "

In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the ""unblessed"" error.

ham,"NYTimes.com Article: Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be SealedThis article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. Another reminder that the moral writ of intellectual property is -- and ought to --be more limited than real property. Private money paid for these bits, but expropriation may be fairer for IP than real-P. Rohit khare@alumni.caltech.edu Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be Sealed September 30, 2002 By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON What is almost certainly the most sophisticated and complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin towers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in Lower Manhattan. Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nation's most respected engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit, helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses. An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings. But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of victims fear that the closely held information, which includes the analysis and the possible answers that families and engineers around the world have craved, may remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that certain material can remain secret for the time being - has approved standard legal arrangements that, should the lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial material generated by the competing sides to be withheld. ""We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but we can't until we're told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy, an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates, who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""Why Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail"" (Norton, 2nd edition, 2002). ""Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the south tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper Safety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed. ""If they have answers and are not going to share them, I would be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have a moral obligation."" The lawsuit that has generated the information involves Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the trade center property, and a consortium of insurance companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half that amount, as the insurance companies say. As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers. Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of Hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said of the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today."" He conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20 insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material. As for his own company, whose consultants alone have produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to ""public authorities and investigative teams."" Still, some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his company's ability to release information. In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents would be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with applicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate with ""federal investigations."" The fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell, given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few resources, a lack of access to crucial information like building plans, and infighting among experts and officials. A new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has studied many building disasters. Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of the real estate executive's own heavily financed investigative work, ""We decline to comment other than to say that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST investigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but said no transfer had taken place. With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. ""The work should be available to other investigators,"" said Ramon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner at Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier inquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in the future."" Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes, from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information. In some cases, litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to have them sealed forever. ""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another, some legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a First Amendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the information, the court might look favorably on requests to make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people, especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence - not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests - could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center. ""It's important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas, director of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure Analysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the case, ""because then the general engineering community can sort it out."" The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images - which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped pinpoint the structural failures. The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a consultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell. Though the FEMA team could not determine ""where things actually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we've indicated the specific locations."" Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details of the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr. Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators. And the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind tunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed the weakening structures. Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort Collins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For the legal case, Dr. Cermak said, ""we've done probably more detailed measurements than in the original design."" ""The data that have been acquired are very valuable in themselves for understanding how wind and buildings interact,"" Dr. Cermak said. ""Some of the information may be valuable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""I think I've told you all I can."" http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1 HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people navigate familiar terrain visually. In other words, it is not intended as a wannabe spy satellite. Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model of the earth's surface. When a particular region in question is covered in a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the earth's surface. The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data. Got it? -James Rogers jamesr@best.com "

ham,"[zzzzteana] And deliver us from weevilhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.html Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London James Meek, science correspondent Tuesday October 8, 2002 The Guardian They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants. Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh. ""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London who discovered the creatures in the UK. The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species, otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay."" He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has established itself firmly in the same area. Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface. One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a fact. ------------------------ Yahoo!

ham,"Different ways of creating a USB-install stickFrom nobody Mon Mar 5 10:42:14 2018 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Hello, I'm curious as to the different ways one can create a USB install stick, for the purpose of installing Debian. It is possible to do it by a) acquiring (where?) a boot.img.gz file, and then doing ""zcat boot.img.gz > /dev/sdc"". Then load a netboot iso to the disc. b) making a FAT/FAT32 partition on the stick, and then doing ""syslinux /dev/sdXX"", copying vmlinuz and initrd.gz to the stick c) using Unetbootin with an .iso file I like the way Unetbootin allows one to use a larger .iso (dvd, or full cd iso). The downside of a) and b) is that you can only use the smaller netboot .isos, and if I wanted to load a few more files onto the disc for use I wouldn't have the room to do so. Does anyone know another method? I'm particularly interested in knowing the way to do what Unetbootin does manually, so that I could load a cd/dvd iso onto the stick after making it boot-able.

There are a number of reasons to think that CO2 is not important to controlling global temperature and that much of the CO2 increase may not be anthropogenic. Some recent research points worth mentioning: Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly causative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a fairly stable fashion. I don't believe anyone really has an authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet. With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years. At previous cycle peaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now. If this cycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete cyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and time), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now. As it happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical record. At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2 concentrations. Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately affects temperature. Again, the interaction is not entirely predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative feedback systems mentioned above. Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it makes up for it in volume in some cases. Gases such as water and methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule basis. Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the biosphere. CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver. I certainly don't think it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in understanding warming trends. Cheers, -James Rogers jamesr@best.com "

Sometimes, and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together. I know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things do happen. I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation now. If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce. Again, these situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished and teeming with AIDS.

If all you're doing is appending to a log file then you're write-intensive. For example, some INN servers using cycbuffs are write-intensive if they can forward the articles out to the peers before they disappear from cache. OLTP databases have indices (or hash tables or whatever) that need to be read even when writing a new record. Then of course, the data that has been written needs to be used for something such as fulfillment and analysis. Both are mostly reads. Backup from the live DB is all reads.

Well, for watching movies in your PC you can always use the media player abilities to re-scale the video into 4:3 aspect ratio :-) But if your vga card cannot provide higher resolutions to the monitor, then you are stuck: LCDs can only work well at their native resolution. So your first step should be to find the specs of your VGA card and check what is the maximum resolution it can provide. Your display will be happy at 1680x1050@60Hz.

ham,"RGB Balance video effectI'm trying to apply an RGB Balance effect (kRGBColorBalanceImageFilterType) to a video track, and I just end up with a movie that's solid black all the way through. I have working code that uses a cross-fade effect, and a lot of the code is the same. I'm guessing that the most likely location of the problem is in constructing the effect description. Here's the code: 	QTAtomContainer	atomCont; 	OSStatus	err = QTNewAtomContainer( &atomCont ); 	ThrowIfOSStatus_( err ); 	 	UInt32		myLong = EndianU32_NtoB( kRGBColorBalanceImageFilterType ); 	err = QTInsertChild( atomCont, kParentAtomIsContainer, 		kParameterWhatName, kParameterWhatID, 0, 		sizeof(myLong), &myLong, NULL ); 	ThrowIfOSStatus_( err ); 	myLong = EndianU32_NtoB( inSrcName ); 	err = QTInsertChild( atomCont, kParentAtomIsContainer, 		kEffectSourceName, 1, 0, sizeof(myLong), &myLong, NULL ); 	ThrowIfOSStatus_( err ); 	Fixed		myFixed; 	myFixed = EndianS32_NtoB( FloatToFixed( inRedFactor ) ); 	err = QTInsertChild( atomCont, kParentAtomIsContainer, 		'rmul', 1, 0, sizeof(myFixed), &myFixed, NULL ); 	ThrowIfOSStatus_( err ); 	 	myFixed = EndianS32_NtoB( FloatToFixed( inGreenFactor ) ); 	err = QTInsertChild( atomCont, kParentAtomIsContainer, 		'gmul', 1, 0, sizeof(myFixed), &myFixed, NULL ); 	ThrowIfOSStatus_( err ); 	 	myFixed = EndianS32_NtoB( FloatToFixed( inBlueFactor ) ); 	err = QTInsertChild( atomCont, kParentAtomIsContainer, 		'bmul', 1, 0, sizeof(myFixed), &myFixed, NULL ); 	ThrowIfOSStatus_( err ); 	 	return atomCont; The docs say that the 3 parameters can be tweens, so I thought, well, maybe they must be tweens, but I had no better luck when I tried making them tweens.

I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. Read this email to the end, follow the instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25 going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing this same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why that day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close to imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical. Not only are you making money from your own business, you're helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams. Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get AT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital. Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN): ================================================== Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the business potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money. Their findings proved that there are ""absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only $25 in startup costs."" DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU WILL MAKE. This is what one had to say: ""I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but each time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out that night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed. Two weeks went by . . . . nothing. Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars rolled in. At this point I was just relieved to get my money back. Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find $580 in $5 bills waiting for me. Its been about 8 months now, and I just bought a new Mercedes . . . black :) The startup costs are so small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week. Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?"" Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never believed in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to win the Super Bowl. I got this email the following morning, and I felt like gambling. I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other $25 paying a parking ticket. I followed the instructions meticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back. As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled my $25. I'd take that over the Patriots any day. I got excited, and that's when it started to explode. In less than 6 weeks I was already up $9500 bucks. It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped. On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.

These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture, you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT http://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to plug in your own numbers and see the results. METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports. Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you. $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. **ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET: Cash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole proprietors. However, this program will only work if you are willing to put in the time and effort to make it work. This is not a program for everybody.

The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain information proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be required to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I was wondering if anyone else has received such a call? I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and the likes).

It is based on the fact that the 'official installer' overwrites files belonging to debian packages. When those packages someday get upgraded, they overwrite what the nvidia driver installed, and then things break. I have helped enough people fix that kind of mess to know. Just a simple fact. Overwriting packages owned by a package is always a bad idea no matter how it is done, because someday the package will overwrite it back on you. > What tricked me yesterday: Why don't I get the 2.6.32-4 kernel that > works with the 195.36.15 Nvidia driver although I have > linux-image-2.6-amd64 installed?

My wife thought it was rather unfriendly that her last upgrade (which gave her a new kernel) took away X. Sure recompiling the module with module-assistant was easy, but it had to be done manually.

I am not sure if it works with it yet. Those running their own kernels would of course never notice that problem since they have the full sources installed the way the nvidia makefiles assumed it would be.

ham,"[zzzzteana] Betamax finally laid to restNot fortean, but a moment in time all the same... http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000 more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better quality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year, 1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the film rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. ""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the format. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the television and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin for Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say, although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no new ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's) ==> The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past, which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ... between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence under Lorenzo the Magnificent? -------------- De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do not. The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property. What they don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital and allow it to start growing. Their property can only be exchanged with a small section of people who know them personally.

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them? Enough. If you want to make money with your computer, then you should hook up with a group that is actually DOING it. We are making a large, continuing income every month. What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing. This business is done completely by internet and email, and you can even join for free to check it out first. If you can send an email, you can do this. No special ""skills"" are required. How much are we making? Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month. We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time. But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work, and rake in the cash. That kind of job does not exist. But if you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be just the thing you are looking for. This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is done FOR you - it is all based on your effort. But, as I said, there are no special skills required. And this income is RESIDUAL - meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase each month also). Interested? I invite you to find out more. You can get in as a free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you decide it is not for you.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind. Looking forward to hearing from you! Sincerely, Hugh Zou P.S.

Where do the grub2 scripts get their UUIDs from, so I can replace the > wrong UUIDs with the right ones? Re 1. Your swap partition's UUID must be different. Check ""/etc/initramfs-tools/"". There is a ""resume"" file (in that dir or in a subdir) that will have your swap partition's UUID. Re 2. What do you mean by ""After changing the UUID of the new partition""? After ""dd..."", did your run ""tune2fs -U ..."" on your root partition (or the equivalent for xfs, ...; I am assuming that you have just one partition)? If you didn't, your root partition still has the same UUID and update-grub is picking it up correctly (in which case, I have no idea idea how you are booting up!). -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

It does not, the kernel is sort of a self-decompressing binary. However, the vga= parameter is indeed parsed by the bootloader and passed to the kernel by a special protocol. It's then used before the kernel parses its command line. > I'm going to have to try installing Squeeze using extlinux as the boot > loader. (No doubt I'll have to change bootloaders after installation, > as the Debian Installer won't offer that option.) Yes, you'll have to back out of Grub installation, start a shell, chroot into /target, and install exlinux. Take care to have /boot on an ext2 partition. -- Good luck!

Yes ;) first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released version. That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your own. second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means ""so much has been changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release anyway"". So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.

spam,"Lasik special starting at $299 - Act Now My dear Brother,--If I have stayed away from Issoudun, and kept up no intercourse with any one, not even with you, the fault lies not merely with the strange and false ideas my father conceived about me, but with the joys and sorrows of my life in Paris; for if God made me a happy wife, he has also deeply afflicted me as a mother. You are aware that my son, your nephew Philippe, lies under accusation of a capital offence in consequence of his devotion to the Emperor. Therefore you can hardly be surprised if a widow, compelled to take a humble situation in a lottery-office for a living, should come to seek consolation from those among whom she was born. The Commissary shrugged his shoulders. Arrest them! he exclaimed, much amused. Ah, monsieur, but you are sanguine! No officer of justice has ever succeeded in arresting le Colonel Caoutchouc, as we call him in French. He is as slippery as an eel, that man. He wriggles through our fingers. Suppose even we caught him, what could we prove? I ask you. Nobody who has seen him once can ever swear to him again in his next impersonation. He is impayable, this good Colonel. On the day when I arrest him, I assure you, monsieur, I shall consider myself the smartest police-officer in Europe. Marrier took charge of him.The hail's goin' to drive all through the night, Giant Tom called out in the darkness. Hazard broke in here in a warmer tone: I know you better than you know yourself! Do you think that I, whose business it is to witness every day of my life the power of my faith, am going to hesitate before a trifle like your common, daily, matter-of-course fears and doubts, such as have risen and been laid in every mind that was worth being called one, ever since minds existed? .Yes, sir. Intent on doing this, she walked along the dusty high road by the river, in the direction of the railway station. This station was more than two miles distant, a long, straight walk by the river, and then a mile or so across fields and by narrow lanes to an arid spot, where some newly-built houses were arising round a hopeless-looking little loop-line station in a desert of agricultural land. We left him, scaled the cliff, and turned up a broad, pleasant valley toward the interior. As it nears Cincinnati the Ohio narrows and deepens, and the banks rise more abruptly. Henry kept close to the southern shore, his body often touching the soft earth. Fortunately the bushes grew thickly, even on the steep cliff, to the water's edge. When he had gone three or four hundred yards he pulled in among them and lay still awhile. He heard the sound of distant shots and he knew that the Indians were still sniping the camp. The curve of the Ohio hid the boats of his friends, and before him the river seemed to be deserted. Yet he was sure that the Indian canoes were on watch. They might be hovering within fifty yards of him. There were men in this very group who had not heard from home since they left it two years before, and there were letters for men who would never receive them. The letters were being given out at various points, but where Harry stood a major was calling them in a loud, clear voice. We led him out to the door. The policeman, in obedience to Charles's orders, held him tight with his hand, but steadily refused, as the prisoner was not violent, to handcuff him. We hailed a passing hansom. To Bow Street! Charles cried, unceremoniously pushing in policeman and prisoner. The driver nodded. We called a four-wheeler ourselves, in which my brother-in-law, Dr. Beddersley and myself took our seats. Follow the hansom! Charles cried out. Don't let him out of your sight. After him, close, to Bow Street! Lasik special starting at $299 - Act Now A murmur came from the group of Chouans, and it was easy to see that the authority of the new chief was about to be disputed. The young man, on whom this effect of his words was by no means lost, was thinking of the best means of maintaining the dignity of his command, when the trot of a horse was heard in the vicinity. All heads turned in the direction from which the sound came. A lady appeared, sitting astride of a little Breton horse, which she put at a gallop as soon as she saw the young leader, so as to reach the group of Chouans as quickly as possible. Good! and what risks do you not run by not believing? But let us talk of the worldly aspect of the matter, which most appeals to you. The finger of God is visible in human affairs; see how He directs them by the hand of His vicar on earth. How much men have lost by leaving the path traced out for them by Christianity! So few think of reading Church history, that erroneous notions deliberately sown among the people lead them to condemn the Church; yet the Church has been a pattern of perfect government such as men seek to establish to-day. The principle of election made it for a long while the great political power. Except the Catholic Church, there was no single religious institution which was founded upon liberty and equality. Everything was ordered to this end. The father-superior, the abbot, the bishop, the general of an order, and the pope were then chosen conscientiously for their fitness for the requirements of the Church. They were the expression of its intelligence, of the thinking power of the Church, and blind obedience was therefore their due. I will say nothing of the ways in which society has benefited by that power which has created modern nations and has inspired so many poems, so much music, so many cathedrals, statues, and pictures. I will simply call your attention to the fact that your modern systems of popular election, of two chambers, and of juries all had their origin in provincial and oecumenical councils, and in the episcopate and college of cardinals; but there is this difference,--the views of civilization held by our present-day philosophy seem to me to fade away before the sublime and divine conception of Catholic communion, the type of a universal social communion brought about by the word and the fact that are combined in religious dogma. It would be very difficult for any modern political system, however perfect people may think it, to work once more such miracles as were wrought in those ages when the Church as the stay and support of the human intellect. It isn't that. But you've never carried baskets, Judge. Gustave pondered. Yes, there were many lodgings, he informed the lady. And then he thought of Madame Magnotte. Was it not his duty to secure this stray lodger for that worthy woman, if possible? said that Shields was advancing to Manassas Gap with ten thousand men, and from what we heard we know that is true. A second detachment, also ten thousand strong, from McDowell's army is coming toward Front Royal, and McDowell has twenty thousand men east of the Blue Ridge. What the forces to the west are I don't know but the enemy in face of the general himself on the Potomac must now number at least ten thousand. the giddy vortex which keeps so many young people revolving aimlessly, till they go down or are cast upon the shore, wrecks of what they might have been, he gave a shrug and answered briefly: As you please. I'll bring you home as early as you like, and Effie Waring shall take your place in the German. What flowers shall I send you?? It is good, admitted the hunter as he sat Turkish fashion on the leaves, and spread out his hands before the growing flames. The nights grow cold mighty soon here in the high hills of the north, and the heat not only loosens up your muscles, but gives you new courage. "

If this is new behaviour in a previously working network, what did you do to it? Test the cables by switching which machine has which. Test the hub ports by switching cables around. Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are. Test the network card... by replacing the thing! Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139 based card costs less than 20 euro. The design is a couple of generations later - more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the card and it's PCI.

ham,"a deadlock problemHi XFS developers, When studying xfs code(2.4.19), I found that the inode will be locked by XFS_ILOCK_SHARE flags before we get acl, which may cause deadlock. Because when getting acl, it will allocate memory in KM_SLEEP, If the memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may lock(XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)the same inode again. If between these two locks, another process try to lock the inode by XFS_ILOCK_EXCL, these two processes will be deadlock. As follows, A process get ea B process want lock ipA 1) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) ..................... | | | | get acl 2) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL) | | | | memory tight | | xfs_stragegy | | 3)xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) ............................ these two processes will be dead lock. So I believe that acl allocation GFP_MASKshould be changed to KM_NOFS. right? best regards wdd "

Easy. First, you'll have to excuse me as I'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this may not play well with recent changes. (I did look at 2.5.1, too). And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it (**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested. Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults: *Fops.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup *Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:		Catch-up all b4 cur *Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	My_Mark2CurSeen Then you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the ""source hook"" under Prefs->Hacking Support) It's going to look something like this: proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} { global exmh pick msg Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id) set pick(ids) [...get message ids for ""pick 1-cur""...] busy PickMarkSeen Exmh_Status ok blue } (that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen) You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of time!

Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new= iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac. The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u= se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi= sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with= a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo= r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m= odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software. As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon= itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut= ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac. Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will = be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with = improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t= he background photo as often as every 5 seconds. But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch= eap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a disc= ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr= ent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h= ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst= em for the retail price of $129. Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu= alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s= hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser= vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou= s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software. Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web serv= ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t= o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service= s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a= service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu= res. Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell w= ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture= . Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously = free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when= free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to= form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently= . To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of= services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz= ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,= an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel= l for the program. Microsoft's moves Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a= rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software= bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re= bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for= those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no= t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000= copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the = program went on sale last November. Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third co= llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after= a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c= ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o= perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co= uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f= ixes are available as separate downloads. Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro= soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a = site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T= he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java = inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the= forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004. Somebody's watching you You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah= oo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter= to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that= pertain to Web code known as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contai= n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS= cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser= to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for = example. ""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced = e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will = open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma= nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command = line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'= s knowledge. On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g= overnment is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious acti= vity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor= e details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan= to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or = suspicious behavior. ""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail= y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual= or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. = But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,= fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib= ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

ham,"ValidationURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85395270 Date: Not supplied I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me (or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1]. I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0: _Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._ Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing wrong, and they don't listen. Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, stupid, incompetent buffoons? ""I told you so."" never felt so good. Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about fucking time.

ham,"NYTimes.com Article: After Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil LibertyThis article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by luke@applix.com. The mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice. The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing. The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy. We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11. luke@applix.com After Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil Liberty August 4, 2002 By THE NEW YORK TIMES This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil A. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. In the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John Ashcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal government and ""every available statute"" to hunt down and punish ""the terrorists among us."" The roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with wartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions of more than 1,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or fighting for the enemy. The government's effort has produced few if any law enforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been released or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held. But it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being waged in federal courthouses around the country, that experts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance between individual liberties and national security. The main combatants are the attorney general and federal prosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders, immigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil libertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other, with federal judges in between. The government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As it has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits, the courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed back, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's tactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them. Federal judges have, however, allowed the government to hold two American citizens without charges in military brigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map for how they might even challenge their detentions. In the nation's history, the greatest battles over the reach of government power have occurred against the backdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current restrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by historical standards and in light of the risks the nation faces. The current struggle centers on three sets of issues. People held simply for immigration violations have objected to new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret, and they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on what they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. People brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those thought to have information about terrorist plots, have argued that they should not be held to give testimony in grand jury investigations. Finally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two Americans labeled ""enemy combatants"" for what the government contends is more direct involvement with terrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be fundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's representation and a chance to challenge their detentions before a civilian judge. So far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered secret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny, and on Friday a federal district judge in Washington ordered that the identities of most of the detainees be made public under the Freedom of Information Act. ""Secret arrests,"" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the decision on Friday, ""are a concept odious to a democratic society."" A senior Justice Department official said the detentions had been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to ""prove a negative"" and cite specific terrorist acts that had been disrupted. But he said that department officials believed that the detentions had ""incapacitated and disrupted some ongoing terrorist plans."" Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on whether the government may jail material witnesses while they wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In Virginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow Mr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. ""I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer them on, because they are doing exactly what an independent judiciary should be doing,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor at the University of Minnesota and former executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ""It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply skeptical."" These lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet been tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that appeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more sympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments. The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance, reversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a lawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider additional evidence and arguments. But even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the government's sweeping argument that the courts have no role in reviewing the government's designation of an American citizen as an enemy combatant. The detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of the Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were cabdrivers, construction workers or other types of laborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before being cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. Last month, at a conference held by a federal appeals court, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the Clinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant attorney general under President Bush, saying that the administration's refusal to identify the people it had detained reminded him of the ""disappeareds"" in Argentina. ""I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the mothers marching in the streets asking for the names of those being held by the government,"" Mr. Christopher said. ""We must be very careful in this country about taking people into custody without revealing their names."" Mr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from Vietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was taken away in 1975 for ""re-education."" In contrast, he said, those detained by the United States were not being secretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek lawyers. ""These are not incognito detentions,"" he said. ""The only thing we will not do is provide a road map for the investigations."" According to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than 1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on immigration charges. Officials said recently that 81 remained in detention. Court papers indicate there were about two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other detainees were held on various state and federal criminal charges. President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected foreign terrorists before military tribunals, though no such charges have been brought yet. Last month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding in Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a British citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his shoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very establishment of those tribunals ""has the effect of diminishing the American jury, once the central feature of American justice."" Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, added: ""This is the most profound shift in our legal institutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all - it has taken place without engaging any broad public interest whatsoever."" Jack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the University of Chicago Law School, have written that the Bush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to civil liberties especially compared with changes during the times of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What has changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil liberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. The Secrecy U.S. Says Hearings Are Not Trials Ten days after last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the nation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping instructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out to be more than 600 ""special interest"" immigration cases. ""Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all other cases on the docket,"" Judge Creppy wrote. ""The courtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no family, and no press."" ""This restriction,"" he continued, ""includes confirming or denying whether such a case is on the docket."" The government has never formally explained how it decided which visa violators would be singled out for this extraordinary process, and it has insisted that the designations could not be reviewed by the courts. But as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and Muslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for example at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious neighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that only a few of these detainees had any significant information about possible terrorists. As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of legal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking legal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have ordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable skepticism about the government's justifications for its detention policies generally. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the hardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on violations that in the past would not have resulted in incarceration. ""Preventive detention,"" he said, ""is such a radical departure from constitutional traditions that we certainly shouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice Department's say-so."" Malek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had it not given rise to one of the legal challenges that threatens to end the secret proceedings. Mr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa 14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than a decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven an ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him about a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr. Zeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa soon cost him 40 days in custody. When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his detention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr. Zeidan's cousin and reporters. The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal court, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers. In March, the government dropped the ""special interest"" designation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond, and the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration charges against him will be considered in the fall. ""You're one of the lucky ones,"" his lawyer, Regis Fernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other visa violators were held as long as six or seven months before being deported or released. Mr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy, which focused on openness, forced the government's hand. ""The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,"" Mr. Fernandez said. ""We figured if the public had access to these hearings they would see that nothing went on except multiple adjournments and delay."" Through a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An I.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's case and in similar cases. He said the immigration service had always detained people without bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He added that the agency had no choice now but to detain a visa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was sure the person was not involved in terrorism. ""Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days and then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he was a terrorist,"" the official said. The newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once reached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers contain one of the fullest accounts of its position on secrecy and executive power. Its main argument is that the courts have no role because immigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely administrative hearings that can be closed at will. Bennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he was flabbergasted by this suggestion. ""A trial is a trial,"" he said. ""A person's liberty is at stake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being told where to live."" But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases, Dale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for counterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I., outlined the reasoning behind the government demand for total secrecy. ""Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous in isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist groups,"" he said. This rationale for withholding information, sometimes called the mosaic theory, is controversial. ""It's impossible to refute,"" Professor Kirtley said, ""because who can say with certainty that it's not true?"" In May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal district court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan, ruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation hearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is able to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case basis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the month before, though that case involved only a single detainee. The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge Bissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court, which will hear arguments in September, declined to do that. A number of news organizations, including The New York Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in support of the newspapers. The government then asked the United States Supreme Court to stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively unusual move given that the case was not before it for any other purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting that it might have more sympathy for the government's arguments. The Witnesses Rights Violated, Lawyers Contend Late on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled two nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul Mohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They were carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000 in cash and had also shaved their body hair. The agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used box cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and had received letters instructing them to ""shave excess hair from the body."" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said there was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian men were involved in, or ""were associated"" with, those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. But even though government officials told reporters that the men had been detained as material witnesses, their lawyers now say that they were held last fall only on immigration violations. The distinction is important because a material witness warrant brings the automatic appointment of a government-paid lawyer, while the government does not have to supply a visa violator with counsel. As a result, the authorities were able to question each of the men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer present, their current lawyers say. Like some of the people who were picked up as material witnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails in New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr. Azmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did, their lawyers say. ""It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never bring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,"" Mr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an interview. ""It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney at the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S. investigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main inquiry into the World Trade Center debacle."" Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his client was interrogated ""often times for several hours a day, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire questions from three or four different people."" Eventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men of any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in June in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting sentencing. Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men consented to questioning. Each ""was read and waived his Miranda rights before each interview,"" prosecutors wrote, adding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses. The United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey, would not comment on the specific cases, but said generally of the government's tactics: ""I don't see any violation of any rule, regulation, or law. ""I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,"" he said. ""But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every available tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole field and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole field. ""We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate and disrupt,"" he added. Today, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen material witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being detained. But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred intense criticism. Last April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law ""to detain people who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in order to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of the statute."" Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when witnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for grand jury investigations. ""Since 1789,"" Judge Scheindlin said, ""no Congress has granted the government the authority to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that he will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal investigation."" Then last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the government's use of the material witness statute in grand jury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's reasoning. Judge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief Justice John Marshall that ""the public has a right to every man's evidence,"" held that detentions of material witnesses during investigations are proper. The War Captives No Lawyers Allowed Under U.S. Label Yasser Esam Hamdi, a Saudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably an American citizen by virtue of having been born in Louisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind of role the nation's courts should have, if any, in reviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged with something akin to a war crime. Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in Norfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal judges who has shown resistance to the government's approach that once someone is declared an ""enemy combatant"" by the president, all judicial review ceases. Judge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan, has twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and ordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal public defender, to be allowed to visit him without government officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar said that ""fair play and fundamental justice"" require it. He said the government ""could not cite one case where a prisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United States District Court, who was held incommunicado and indefinitely."" But the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge Doumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the government's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and, more important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of foreign and military affairs. ""The authority to capture those who take up arms against America belongs to the commander in chief,"" Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at the breadth of what the government was asserting when he asked the Justice Department's lawyer, ""You are saying that the judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's stature as an enemy combatant?"" The government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide the court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by which they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant. But the government has argued that judges cannot argue with the standards. Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the government closely on those standards. The case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far as that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge to normal judicial procedures. Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like Mr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig after having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike Mr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield by the military but on United States soil by civil law enforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. After his detention as a material witness based on suspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and information to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred to military custody. ""This is the model we all fear or should fear,"" said Mr. Dunham, the public defender. ""The executive branch can arrest an American citizen here and then declare him an enemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the courts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him or giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any evidence."" http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/national/04CIVI.html?ex=1029550865&ei=1&en=c82350bcf915e44e HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is done for the benefit of, companies based in the US. The spam often appears to originate there because it's coming from open http, or squid proxy servers. It's hosted there because these spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs. One hardly needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US citizen is violating US law. > - Law suits take time.

Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to the news media. If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've heard of PopLaunch, right?) > - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst. Seems she had an open file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude photos: http://belps.freewebsites.com/ I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in confirming the validity of the information found online. There were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC released the following: http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.

ham,Xorg and cpu usageFrom nobody Mon Mar 5 10:42:14 2018 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Hello there. I own a dell studio 1555 with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD4570. I have a debian testing installation and currently I have to use either radeon or the radeonhd drivers cause the proprietary (fglrx) driver doesn't support the xserver currently available in testing. Everything works just fine. I even got 3d acceleration and Kwin effects. The problem is that the xorg process is using the cpu and consuming much memory. The memory consumed is about 160MB but that doesn't really bother me cause I got plenty of it :P. Well the annoying thing is the cpu fan; xorg uses about 10% (as shown in kde's system monitor) and so the fan does never stop. Has anyone else spotted any high cpu usage when using those drivers? If I disable the kde effects the memory consumption gets lower but the cpu is still in heavy use by the xorg process. Well I got a few more questions about these open source drivers. Does anyone know if they have power saving enabled? I think when I used the fgrlx driver the battery lasted much longer. I also got an issue with suspend. It worked with the fglrx driver but with the opensource drivers the laptop doesn't wake up. Well it does but the display shows nothing. I have to play with alt+ctrl+f* before it shows something. Then if I type my pass I can see that the s2ram process is consuming 50% of the cpu! One time when doing so the laptop turn off by itself. I think it overheated so that makes me think that something goes wrong with the acpi after waking up from suspend. Sorry for the long post. Thanks in advance for any help. J

ham,"EBusiness Webforms: cluetrain has left the stationWhat's wrong with doing business over the Web? Web forms. There's promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the industry: o You find something that you want to fill out. It's a partnership form, a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything. o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized. I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except about two dozen third world countries. o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain about using the universal country phone number format and will cause you to re-enter dashes instead of dots. o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to go back and resent that freaking thing too. Finally after all combinations of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit. o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation. o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their forms submission. What's wrong with this picture? The company is screwing you by wasting your time enforcing their data collection standards on you. I'm sure there's someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA"" ""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them to waste even more time playing Web form geography. I'm starting to see the light of Passport. You want more information? Hit this passport button. Voila. IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff, but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff. So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as working all that well.

ham,"Re: My brain hurtsMore than a dozen jokes - thanks guys and girls! (plus some anti-French abuse from the usual suspect). Well my brain doesn't hurt so much any more, and it was well worth it. I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting, both pratically and asymptotically. It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)), or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation. Before the best methods took O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it. The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes time O(n^(3+eps)). Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding some logarithmic factors. After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the number of points on the curve. Here's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using a 1 GHz Pentium III: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ > ./ecpc4 -d 1009 -j 0x123 INFO: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- INFO: -=-=-=-=-= ECPC: Elliptic Curve Point Counting, made easy! =-=-=-=-=- INFO: -=-=-=-=-= v4.0.0.

Problematic? Difficult to judge, since I somehow lost track of what exactly you tried to achieve and what is the nature of the document. If you are simply afraid, that someone would use this document as her/his own work you could watermark the pdf and convert it to a low resolution bitmap (as others have already suggested). If the document was later misused, you could just show your nice, high quality printout without watermarks to prove that you are the real author. Another way might be to hand out that bad quality printout on some special paper, either coloured or with rules and keep the pdf version to yourself. It will be about as difficult to retype/recreate such a document from paper as from retyping it from screen, which was your first choice (disallow printing, allow screen viewing).

The alternative is to install a hook via > QTVisualContextSetImageAvailableCallback() and trigger a semaphore, > but blocking on the Copy call would be much more straightforward. If you are using SetMovieTime and QTVisualContextSetImageAvailableCallback you can do everything on the secondary thread, after attaching the movie to this thread. If you are playing the movie you need to play it on the main thread. Normally you would use a display link callback which calls the QTVisualContextIsNewImageAvailable/QTVisualContextCopyImageForTime combo. Kind of smart polling. If you don't want to poll you can use an ImageAvailableCallback and and an input queue but I don't see much benefit from that. The overhead of the display link is small and if you suspect that your movie has a higher frame rate than the display refresh time you can always call QTVisualContextIsNewImageAvailable multiple times until it returns false. Either you can keep up with the input or else you are going to drop frames. The ImageAvailableCallback won't help you there.

ham,"The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14)-------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is MIME? MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"". It is the standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the world-wide Internet email system. Typical uses of MIME include sending images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file. MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message? Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use which do not understand MIME messages. However, there are a growing number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in. (One popular MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z) In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation capability in their Internet gateway products. However, even if you do not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is still hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME message. One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"". It was developed at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/. There are versions available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems. For compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE? Yes. UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems. MIME uses a more robust encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME? The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: o US East Coast Address: ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10) o US West Coast Address: ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32) o Pacific Rim Address: munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21) o Europe Address: nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt Another source of information is the Internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"", which includes a periodic posting of a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" list. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork "

Not very muddied at all. What does that exactly have to do with the statement that distruption of peacable political assembly has become a common practice disruption tool? It's an observation not a judgement, comment, approval. You've focused on the word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one I posted.

ham,"Re: FromThis is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and mh. Your sysadmin is wrong. It is the responsibility of the receiving mail server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that facility. It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem. Since mh is unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the spool. I had this same problem. There are several ways to fix it: 1) Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail. This means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "". Any such line will look like "">From "". 2) There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"". When I was having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, then nmh development stalled for a long time. I doubt it has been done, but you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure. 3) You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool. This avoids the whole issue. rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and everything works. -- Jim McMaster mailto:mcmasjc@tatanka.stortek.com In message , Jason Rennie said: > > When I receive a message that has a line starting with ""From "", it's > broken into two messages.

ham,"NYTimes.com Article: Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than GoodThis article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. Sure does explain FoRK :-) not yet abandoned, Rohit khare@alumni.caltech.edu Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good September 10, 2002 By MARY DUENWALD Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years, scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress, they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible to the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie, insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. ""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy, envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford, advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside. ""There's this myth that friendships should last a lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that they end."" That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships - between siblings or parents and children - have been seen as more important. Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad. As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr. Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my best friend hits me."" Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes, like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health. ""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for stability the way it was in the past, and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr. Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose, a professor of psychology at Florida International University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has negative characteristics."" The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said. So far they have only, through surveys and interviews, figured out that it is a significant problem. The early research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior."" Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential."" Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent treatment is actually malicious."" At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr. Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her ""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since, Dr. Yager said. Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse, but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or she finds out."" Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them, but then isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do, when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one. ""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to discover there's something important they don't like about the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International. ""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense, it may take even more time for one person to meet the other's dislike criteria."" Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said, ""depends on how large the injury is."" ""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" Acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one. But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to get together, ever. ""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship, but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. ""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you're healthy and your life and work are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits, when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and life-preserving good friendship is."" http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977 HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

I assume that how much the trust goes down depends of the proportion of report vs revoke. If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the one guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the majority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your trust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither against the majority nor with it, so your trust won't change. So your ""gray"" mail won't have much influence on your trust (neither good nor bad, just... gray) ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Razor-users mailing list Razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users "

As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10 before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.

The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant points in its favor, it still manages to suck, and break across JVMs. I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU compiler collection. But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are probably not source-available or tolerably licenced. When I looked at what I had to do to gcc and link ""hello world,"" I lost interest. Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway? Why are Perl/Python/Ruby more reliable? In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single portable JVM that just works. My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze browser java implementations. Eirikur "

ham,"aptitude update thinks there are no updates! (solved by deleting 	apt/lists)Hi all, After about a fortnight, I tried to update my Debian squeeze desktop, and I was using the mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in mirror. After downloading the repository lists, it tells me there are no updates -- I am surprised as I know that Gnome 2.30 is already in testing. Thinking that it could be a problem with the mirror, I switch to ftp.ch.debian.org and update. This time, it does say there are about 300 updates. I issue a safe-upgrade, but the electricity goes out just as the updates begin downloading. After I turn the computer back on, issuing a safe-upgrade shows there are no updates! I try to aptitude update but it thinks that the repositories are already updated, though apt-cache show nautilus gives the version 2.28.4. As I was in a hurry at the time, I just deleted /var/lib/apt/lists, so aptitude had no choice but to really download the lists. After this the safe-upgrade proceeded as usual. I realised after deleting /var/lib/apt/lists that I should have kept a copy, but too late. Though the problem is (in a sense) solved, I am curious as to how this (bug?) could have occurred. After all this I checked mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in and it does have nautilus 2.30.1, so maybe the first no-updates scenario was also caused by this bug/problem.

Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit _that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter as much in the embedded world. And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec [fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count. > The real issue is compiler availability.

ham,"asynchronous I/O (was Re: Gasp!)Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for years; and FreeBSD has kqueue. More details about these are at http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/ None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O. POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most proprietary Unixes implement. The Linux kernel hackers are currently rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too. It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base. People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but apparently some don't, so I'll rebut. Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the original stupid errors. In detail, he wrote: > Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally > catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for > nontrivial apps? No way! Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing for many years. Very few applications need the aio_* calls --- essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple threads or processes. This just provides a modicum of extra performance. > OK, so they do it with signals or a flag, which is completely > ghetto, but at least they are trying.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is 13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice. They might be even older than that. Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations have supported multithreading for a decade or more. > Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned > out to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep > looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" > is not really working so great anymore. Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process. By contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process polls them. I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case (although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards. Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo(). -- Kragen Sitaker Edsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.

ham,"How do I get the mbr package to do its job quietly?I have been experimenting with the mbr package. (mbr is a dependency for the lilo package; so if you have lilo installed you have mbr package installed too.) I usually install lilo to the master boot record (boot=/dev/hda specified in /etc/lilo.conf). But in certain situations it is advantageous to install lilo to the boot sector of a primary partition (boot=/dev/hda1) and install a DOS-like master boot record program in the master boot record, making the partition containing the lilo boot loader the active partition. For example, on some of our Dell servers one can bring up a ""boot menu"" via the BIOS setup program by pressing F12 during the POST process. (This is during POST and before the actual boot process.) Upon completion of POST, the ""BIOS boot menu"" (not to be confused with the boot menu of any boot loader) will be displayed. One of the choices in this BIOS boot menu is ""Boot to Utility Partition"", or something like that. This boots a maintenance partition containing some hardware testing programs supplied by Dell. This works fine if the master boot record is a standard DOS/Windows-style master boot record, but does not work with Linux-style boot loaders, such as grub or lilo. Of course, I can always add the maintenance partition to the lilo boot menu, but our non-Linux-proficient technicians aren't used to this. I want a Linux box to look just like a Windows box as viewed by a service technician. I could use DOS or Windows to install its master boot record program with ""fdisk /mbr"" or fixmbr, or whatever, depending on the release of DOS or Windows, and set the Linux partition active, and that works. But Microsoft may claim that this means that our box requires a license for DOS or Windows. I'd hate to burn a Windows license just to get its master boot record installed, when that's all I'm using. It would seem that the mbr package in Debian GNU/Linux is just the ticket for this sort of problem. I have run the ""install-mbr"" program, and it works just as expected. There is just one little nit left that I would like to take care of. lilo advertises itself by printing out ""LILO"" on the screen prior to booting the Linux kernel. That's fine. I want to see that. mbr also advertises itself by printing out ""MBR"" on the screen when it boots. So what I see at boot time is something like this: MBR LILO 22.8 Loading Linux BIOS data check successful and then the Linux kernel boot messages. That's tolerable, but I'd like that ""MBR"" advertisement to be eliminated. I read the man page for install-mbr, and I can see how to eliminate the boot prompt, which I have done, but I couldn't find a way to suppress the MBR advertisement. The DOS/Windows mbr program is totally silent, a trick that I would like to teach this program. Does anyone know of a way to accomplish this? Or is this just something I have to live with? -- .''`.

I don't remember a thread on debian-user about UUIDs changing with changing hardware (I could be wrong though!) but there was a thread in March on ubuntu-users where a guy was duplicating disks for a rollout and he was convinced that the BIOS of the boxes into which he was plugging in the duplicated HDs was changing the UUIDs of the disks' partitions because he was unable to boot from those disks unless he changed the fstab to use /dev/sdaX devices. I pointed out that the idea that a BIOS could change a filesystem's superblock didn't make any sense and that it could not be a UUID problem because he could boot boxes with Intel mobos but not boxes with another manufacturer's mobos (I assume that he could have replied that the other mobos were changing the UUIDs and the Intels ones not...). -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal and business ethics, I apologize in advance. I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo’s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to the confines of his village. The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal that might be of interest to you. My client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad. This fund came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security adviser to the then president. What happened was that he had part of the funds transferred from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could take place the president died. My client has decided to keep this for himself as all his properties has been confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the change of possession to his benefit. I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that can help him facilitate the change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in my possession. The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor. I remain most obliged. Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).

ham,"[ILUG] cdrecord + 2.4.19 = hard-lockHi all, I've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it. I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system. I have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the scsi over ide kernel modules. I was running kernel 2.4.18 until probably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out. Downloaded patch and installed new kernel with no real problems. This morning I went to burn a CDROM, and the system locked hard. Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed cdburning to work fine. This problem is very reproducible (on my system at least). the cdrecord command I was using was cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso The blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just locks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even). AFAICS, the system just stops. Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does reboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages /var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate). cdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my cdr drive and my cdrw). The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking. I tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives the same error. I also downloaded and compiled the source for cdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used which maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted. Anyway, I'm completely stumped. Google searching has not done me much good, and I'm a little bit lost. What I'd like to know is a) How to fix the problem ;-) b) Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem? The severity of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm not very knowledgeable on these things. c) Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond the guidelines on kernel.org)? Like I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully received. mick -- Michael Conry Ph.:+353-1-7161987, Web: http://www.acronymchile.com Key fingerprint = 5508 B563 6791 5C84 A947 CB01 997B 3598 09DE 502C -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Not only do I know that, the post to which you were responding explained that, with somewhat more detail than ""a joke"". As you should know, but evidently don't, poll() isn't even ""a bit better"" --- in fact, it's about an order of magnitude worse --- for dense file descriptor sets, which is the normal case.

After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for nontrivial apps? No way! The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try to tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don't care --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't ""totally suck for nontrivial apps"". For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of concurrent I/O requests. I find references to the glibc implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could probably find much earlier references if I had time: http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html (more details at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/io-events.html; details on the SGI patch are at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/faq.html) > > Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations > > have supported multithreading for a decade or more. > > And most UNIX is still kinda-sorta supporting the pthreads (POSIX) > interface, each in their own 7/8 implementation. You're safe if you > stick to the basics. Your original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading or multiprogramming well. Now that I've pointed out how obviously idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although individual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their implementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads specification. Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written pthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own experience. But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to prefer Windows. I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading implementations. Spare us.

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time. Most systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are. Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions.

You probably will get something close to what you want. Apt-get or aptitude will work its way down sources.list until it finds a working server and update the corresponding section of the proxy cache. But this would make approx create three separate proxy caches, one for each external repository. I think that this is not really what you want. I suggest that you look at /var/cache/approx/ You will find one one subdirectory there for each definition line in your /etc/approx.conf file.

Still, definately something not right about the below. People are now cheaper then a decent laptop? (ok, so we knew that already) ------------- Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET By Andrew Marshall BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her. ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I knew then there was something special."" Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan, who is expecting their first child. Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand in search of a wife. ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring."" Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and the couple married. MR. MARRIAGE Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,"" started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction agency. Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages. ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my knowledge, they have all been successful."" Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount. Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok. Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems. ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,"" Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."" After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every client has found a potential wife. ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows, usually within the next year. Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less than 10 percent have broken up. Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife. ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm down, OK, we'll talk.""' But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic stress disorder. WHY? Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West. But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I need Wan,"" he said. ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband."" Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they choose to use his agency. His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not ""God's gift to women."" Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries -- and found Thai women attractive. ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them? Impossible,"" she said. ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from ladies from other countries."" Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap, the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also not a major obstacle. ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up very quickly."" Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the West. ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them how to eat, and when to make tea."" PITFALLS But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is back in Bangkok, sad and angry. ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never spoke to me."" Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life."" Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out. ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all comers."" Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company, looking for a foreign husband. ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,"" Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal."" "

The master penguin himself, kernel.org, has run on XFS since 2008. Sorry for the body slam. Is your back ok Mark? ;) Pretty sure I just ""won"" this discussion.

The Linux Kernel Archives ""A bit more than a year ago (as of October 2008) kernel.org, in an ever increasing need to squeeze more performance out of it's machines, made the leap of migrating the primary mirror machines (mirrors.kernel.org) to XFS. We site a number of reasons including fscking 5.5T of disk is long and painful, we were hitting various cache issues, and we were seeking better performance out of our file system."" ""After initial tests looked positive we made the jump, and have been quite happy with the results. With an instant increase in performance and throughput, as well as the worst xfs_check we've ever seen taking 10 minutes, we were quite happy. Subsequently we've moved all primary mirroring file-systems to XFS, including www.kernel.org , and mirrors.kernel.org. With an average constant movement of about 400mbps around the world, and with peaks into the 3.1gbps range serving thousands of users simultaneously it's been a file system that has taken the brunt we can throw at it and held up spectacularly."" http://www.xfs.org/index.php/XFS_Companies#The_Linux_Kernel_Archives -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

ham,"Re: Asteroids anyone ?With enough warning, you might not even care about trying to divert the meteor -- you'd divert the Earth instead. I recall reading many years ago about calculations, done separately both by US and USSR scientists for different reasons, about the effect of nuclear explosions on the moon's mass, and thus its orbit, and thus also (over time) the Earth's path around the sun. I believe the conclusion was that mild changes in the moon's composition would have the effect, over several years, of changing significantly where the Earth would be at any certain future point. Voila! No collision -- at least not with the initial threat. And no need to travel out to anywhere near the meteor, either. Just the moon. - Gordon http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork "

KDE 4 is different. I don't like it. If I have to, in effect, change DE, and go through the learning curve again, there is no reason why it would have to be to KDE 4. When the time comes that I cannot sensibly go on using KDE 3, I shall chose where I go next on the basis of what the options are looking like at the time. I can see little liklihood that that choice will be KDE 4. I may even switch to a window manager without a DE, and chose other ways of working, if that is the only way that I can avoid the glitz that is now all the rage. How things look is very important to me. I have problems with my eyes, and how a thing looks can influence whether I can work on a thing for one minute, ten minutes or an hour. I have no problem with other people liking and wanting to use KDE 4. I have a problem with their, in some cases, not allowing me the freedom _not_ to use it. And I personally shall mourn the passing of KDE 3. Lisi -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"". Trouble?

Except that most technical people would probably rather hammer a nail through their forehead than go through the pain of suing someone and dealing with the legal system, the paper work, the time involved ... So looking for a technical solution, even one that requires an enormous amount of development time, makes sense. Maybe the development time is actually a bonus, if you're interested in that sort of tinkering already. All of that being said - this entire thread is really a question of security, and security is a process and an approach, not an end result. There is no such thing as a 100% secure system that is also useful, in the same way that there is no such thing as a 100% secure PDF that is also useful. So the real goal is to make the document ""secure enough"" for one's purposes, while also making the document ""usable enough"" for those purposes. I think there have been a lot of good ideas on this thread for managing that trade-off. -- monique -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

Otherwise, if a file becomes corrupted, you'll never know it, unless you keep your own checksums. There are only a small handful of filesystems that keep checksums of your files. Btrfs and ZFS come to mind. I believe ZFS is more mature than Btrfs, but it isn't in the kernel. I believe the only way to get ZFS on Linux is through FUSE. There's also JFS, which has been around for a number of years, and is mature. It doesn't checksum your files, but it does use copy-on-write (as do Btrfs and ZFS), which goes a long way to keeping your data from getting corrupted, something XFS does not do. So if Btrfs were more mature, or if ZFS were included in the kernel, I'd recommend either of those. But as it is, I think JFS is the way to go. -- Kevin -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"". Trouble?

Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore - not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy saying ""So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic shakeout in Webcasting is ""inevitable and desirable because it will bring about market consolidation."" That's really it in a nutshell. ""Market consolidation"" means the less artists they have to promote, the less ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because that's all you'll be able to find out there.

ham,"LXDE session aborting immediately.Well, not really, but that is what the message says. Actually, it says that the session lasted less than ten seconds, but who's counting. This started happening last Monday night after doing a full-upgrade on my laptop, running Squeeze. In reality: If I click on OK (the only button available) then the session does indeed end and I am dropped back to a login window. If I click the 'X' button, the same thing happens. If I click the 'Minimize' button, however, the message just goes away (it does not appear in the task bar) and I can continue to work as if nothing had happened. I thought that maybe I just had something messed up in some configuration file in my home directory, so I tried creating a new user to see if it still happened there. It did. That eliminates a personal config file from being the problem, but leaves me no closer to an answer. Is anyone else using LXDE on Squeeze having this problem?

ham,"TCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the Masses TCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the Masses While security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces of the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, they have tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as far as concerns such as privacy and security go, or alternatively, in terms of how they would impact the functionality of the general purpose logic device. Analysts both favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from these standpoints, while paying much less attention to what the proposals imply from the standpoint of what content control itself really means. The most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not whether they may interfere with the power of the universal logic device, or whether they are effectual from the standpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these are all very important concerns. Rather, the fundamental problem they present is in the political premises that they hope to implement for the sake of the ""content industries."" TCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the concepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May 20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course). The WPPT declares an unprecedented ""moral right"" of authors to control public uses of their works. *That's* the real game plan. TCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the masses. They constitute an effort to ""democratize"" content control under the concept of ""moral rights,"" encouraging the public to overlook the clear public interest issues raised by the specter of content control, and to confuse these issues with private interest issues such as privacy and security. They are an effort to get the public to jump on the bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's really on the line. In America, we have never supported the concept of ""moral rights"" which the WPPT professes. The US Constitution accords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive rights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting the progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the purpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though that result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights statutes such as copyright law. Our Supreme Court explicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good reason. In America, we implicitly understand the distinction between expression, the aspect of works to which copyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make up a work, to which it does *not* apply. The reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must be stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture: information is free. It's not that it *wants* to be -- it *is* and it always has been. This fact is unassailable, however, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes to ""universal content control"" for the sake of so-called ""moral rights"" implemented at the behest of narrow content industry interests. TCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage the general public, and more specifically producers of information products in general, to identify content control with ""moral rights,"" blithely overlooking the real implications of information technology in a free society, and the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding the freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the prospects of information technology crucially depend.

The fact that you see it in the package file name means that it did not recognize the option. Try it this way: fakeroot make-kpkg clean fakeroot make-kpkg --append-to-version -recompiled --revision x.x.xxx \ --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers Note: you must always issue ""make-kpkg clean"" after running ""make menuconfig"" or after running ""make-kpkg"" with any target other than ""clean"". Otherwise, version and revision numbers will not work as expected. Assuming that you are using official Debian kernel sources, you will want to make the value for --revision match the ""version"" of the linux-source-2.6.32 package.

ham,"blogged itemBlogStart: **Dublin**: something from the archives. Daev Walsh forwards an article from The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''. This story is also immortalised in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track. Billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely legal, way to make money. BlogEnd: LinkText: Billy in the Bowl From: daev Subject: The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler A story of my new neighbourhood... The Irish Digest July 1964 The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors. Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes. Many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one who campaigned among the working class. This was ""Billy In The Bowl"" The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels. Seated in this "" bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs, one in each hand. Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been born without legs. Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an unusually handsome face. This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers-by from their small change. The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would come along. He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his black curly hair, never failed to halt the females. The fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity. ""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money. The more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking. As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening as dusk, was falling. The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on Dublin's North Quays. When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane. As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help. Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay concealed. She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes. In a few minutes it was all over. The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket. An hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant. And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar. Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or Stoneybatter. On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her. The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder and caused a great stir. Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months ""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts. Around this period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder. Months passed and ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old pasttime. A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district. But the beggar still rolled along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected. Then came the night that finished Billy's career of crime. Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help. Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch. Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch. She proved much too strong for him, however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails. Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring. Pulling out her large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye. The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene. Among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy. ""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl. The Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night. daev _______________________________ Rev.

ham,"=?us-ascii?Q?FW:_Re:_Al_Qaeda's_Fantasy_Ideology?=-----Original Message----- From: Damien Morton [mailto:damien.morton@acm.org] Sent: Saturday, 17 August 2002 02:55 To: 'polrev@hoover.stanford.edu' Subject: Re: Al Qaeda's Fantasy Ideology Youre right of course - the attack was performed for its effect on muslims, not for its effect on the US. By showing that it can be done, they inspire others to follow in their path, or so they hope. I take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy, because it is somewhat perjorative. Imagining different worlds can often lead the world to become more like that imagined. Moreso if action is taken on the basis of those imaginings. Theres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that anyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck. This is equally a fantasy, but one made to approach reality through consensus. An interesting question then becomes, if Al Queda's actions are in furtherance of a fantasy, what fantasies are George Bush's actions in furtherace of? How many of the actions of George Bush and the US are performed for their effect on the US population? For example, how much showmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street. Is this not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices Al Queda made? What cultural myopia is in play here in the US? I make a point of reading Australian, Britsish and US news. Today I noticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqi overtures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi war preparations (digging bunkers etc). At a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation on multiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisible preferably) is somewhat appealing. A self fullfilling prophesy, if you like. Perhaps that's whats at work here. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork "

ham,"Re: Questions about RAID 6Mark Allums put forth on 4/27/2010 10:31 PM: > For DIY, always pair those drives. Consider RAID 10, RAID 50, RAID 60, > etc. Alas, that doubles the number of drives, and intensely decreases > the MTBF, which is the whole outcome you want to avoid. This is my preferred mdadm 4 drive setup for a light office server or home media/vanity server. Some minor setup details are omitted from the diagram to keep it simple, such as the fact that /boot is a mirrored 100MB partition set and that there are two non mirrored 1GB swap partitions. / and /var are mirrored partitions in the remaining first 30GB. These sizes are arbitrary, and can be seasoned to taste. I find these sizes work fairly well for a non GUI Debian server. md raid, 4 x 500GB 7.2K rpm SATAII drives: 	mirror			 mirror 	/ \			 / \ -------- 3 -------- -------- 3 -------- | /boot | 0 | /boot | | swap1 | 0 | swap2 | | / | G | / | | /var | G | /var | |--------| |--------| |--------| |--------| | /home | | /home | | /home | | /home | | /samba | | /samba | | /samba | | /samba | | other | | other | | other | | other | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | -------- -------- -------- -------- 	\	\		/	/ ------------------------------- 		 RAID 10 		 940 GB NET For approximately the same $$ outlay one could simply mirror two 1TB 7.2K rpm drives and have the same usable space and a little less power draw. The 4 drive RAID 10 setup will yield better read and write performance due to the striping, especially under a multiuser workload, and especially for IMAP serving of large mailboxen. For a small/medium office server running say Postfix/Dovecot/Samba/lighty+Roundcube webmail, a small intranet etc, the 4 drive setup would yield significantly better performance than the higher capacity 2 drive setup. Using Newegg's prices, each solution will run a little below or above $200. This 4 drive RAID 10 makes for a nice little inexpensive and speedy setup. 1TB of user space may not seem like much given the capacity of today's drives, but most small/medium offices won't come close to using that much space for a number of years, assuming you have sane email attachment policies. -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** (Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM. **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. ""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999) SKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE June 1, 1999: News Release Part One Background: On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: =C2=BB =C2=BB exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). =C2=BB =C2=BB was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. =C2=BB =C2=BB was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. =C2=BB =C2=BB has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek =C2=BB =C2=BB has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political boundaries."" =C2=BB =C2=BB exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. =C2=BB =C2=BB has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: =C2=BB =C2=BB also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). =C2=BB =C2=BB was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, which included the United States, China and the USSR. =C2=BB =C2=BB was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. =C2=BB =C2=BB has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. =C2=BB =C2=BB has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. =C2=BB =C2=BB exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. =C2=BB =C2=BB has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: ""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC =3D Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

SKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.=C2=A0 The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.=C2=A0 The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.=C2=A0 Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.=C2=A0 Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.=C2=A0 The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.=C2=A0 It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.=C2=A0 While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.=C2=A0 The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.=C2=A0 Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.=C2=A0 The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.=C2=A0 The refusal of the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.=C2=A0 Your understanding is appreciated.=C2=A0 SKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE December 19, 1998: News Release Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE July 14, 1998: Communiqu=C3=A9 to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'=C3=AAtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. SKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE May 4, 1997: News Release Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. ""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace. SKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE March 31, 1997: News Release An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: =C2=BB =C2=BB ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". =C2=BB =C2=BB ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" =C2=BB =C2=BB ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and every action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" =C2=BB =C2=BB ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior =C2=BB =C2=BB ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" =C2=BB =C2=BB That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. Request for Media Response: The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) Parting Shot: What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. TOP OF PAGE November 21, 1994: News Release In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: =C2=BB =C2=BB Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. =C2=BB =C2=BB In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. =C2=BB =C2=BB Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. =C2=BB =C2=BB A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military might and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations (e.g. Grenada, Haiti, Cuba, Hawaii, etc., etc.), Mr. Moore, other Ministers and the citizens of EnenKio are determined to peacefully displace the U.S. Occupation Forces and reassert the jurisdiction of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios. Filing the Commercial Affidavit document was the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up in International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. In an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the restoration of democratic control of EnenKio and to gain international recognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the Sovereign and his forebears, the Ministers of EnenKio have sent documents of Notice and request for assistance to the United Nations Security Council, the South Pacific Commission, similar organizations and to the governments of most other nations of the world. It is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment of diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of U.S. troops and relinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. At the same time, Mr. Moore, in the service of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, wishes to inform all of the people being held at Wake Island by force of arms or by contract, that asylum will be offered to them. A similar offer is made to all Marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of EnenKio.

ham,"Pitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind DatesThis is preaty neat. - Adam L. ""Duncan"" Beberg http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/ beberg@mithral.com Pitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ET BERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the bar is pitch black. The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on senses other than sight. Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery and drinks. ""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said. In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like a fish, meat or vegetarian option. ""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and sight-restricted people, which is running the bar. ""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he added. Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind. An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to help, Scharnbach said. And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have actually been eating. "

Has anyone heard of a Mac equivalent? What about a java launcher stub. Use Runtime exec to launch a java process. I think this is what the Apache common launcher project code amounts to. It is based on the Tomcat or some such product launcher code and uses a ant task approach but I think in the end just amounts to Runtime exec'd java.

KDE 4.4 sounds great but it is nowhere to be found in Debian but in experimental and it sounds like it is nowhere near ready for production. 3.5.10 is truly and completely, unusably broken for calendaring other than in a standalone world. It looks like Evolution has introduced webdav support for contacts in 2.24 and we can grab 2.28 from testing.

ham,"Re: thanks for the gamix source rpms! [ALSA stuff]I wish I could answer your question but my laptop does not have the digital stuff hooked up :( so I so not know about it.

ham,"Why we're changing our publishing schedule [ANCHORDESK] ZDNet AnchorDesk Newsletter --> THURSDAY, JULY 18, 2002 &nbsp;David Coursey --> Why we're changing our publishing schedule Dear Reader, As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired. Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you. Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down. For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.

And how do Apple decide which User Groups to 'acknowledge in a proud fashion' There are groups out there that only have a dozen or so members. Others seem to a large portion of members still using PowerPC based machines.

What makes your group 'an ideal audience'? I'm suggesting that you aren't... In fact, I am curious to see how ALL User Groups feel about this point!

Over at my own website, I recently highlighted a series of posts from O'Reilly on how to deal with Speaker Cancelations http://www.appleusers.org/share/oreilly-share-how-to-deal-with-speaker-cancelations/ EVERY group I have ever known has had to deal with this one time or another... I've been in the situation where I've had to find a last minute replacement OR usually BE the last minute replacement. Yes it is embarrassing, but these things do unfortunately happen. I've even been known to be the cause of such cancelations to groups myself :( Often I'm booked month's in advance to present to a group... then circumstances change and I have to cancel. Other times, I've had initial discussions about presenting, again months in advance, and then I hear nothing until the night before the presentation... asking if am I still OK with 'tomorrow' !@#!$!$^ %&^*(Q@# is all I can say. There are plenty of ways of gently reminding a presenter that they have a presentation coming up soon... and harking back to the original topic of this thread... a forwarding of a Press Release you've sent out a month before the meeting that mentions the 'forthcoming meeting next month' is one simple way of doing so. It also shows that you care enough about the topic/presenter to promote it. >> That really annoyed we board members, because we were made to look >> like >> idiots and our general membership was highly disappointed.

In many cases, it is the best place for many people. I hate to say it, but I cringe at some of the comments I see on User Group mailing lists etc about what a product may or may not do and how wrong those responses are! An example I've seen twice on different lists in recent weeks is the point about iPads and if they are 'locked' to AT&T... for starters both people inquiring were talking about iPads with WiFi only - so automatically there is no need to even mention been locked in to AT&T. Secondly, both groups were located in Australia and whilst one was talking about importing an iPad from the US, the other was asking if they could use it in the UK when they visited family there later in the year. Steve Jobs made it abundantly clear in his Keynote speech launching the iPad that it was NOT locked to any carrier... yet on both MUG lists, people responded saying the iPad was likely to be locked in to AT&T and so the people inquiring would not be able to use the iPad as they had hoped... which was just plain wrong! Now, I not saying that User Groups always get it wrong... more often then not they don't and they do actually provide an independent viewpoint... for example, the discussion on this very list about how best to demo an iPad was very enlightening and provided far more information on the topic then I got out of my contacts at Apple Australian (and Apple US) on how do do the same thing when the iPhone first came out here (about 18 months AFTER the US go it - so it wasn't exactly the latest news then and I'm sure others had similar queries at the time). > The message of user groups is lost in the scale of the Apple media > presence. Then it is up to User Groups to address that themselves.... which again harks back to the original topic of this thread Here in Australia, we have taken steps towards addressing this... I produced a full page flyer promoting active Apple User Groups here. See Page 15 of the Feb/Mar issue of the AppleUsers Spotlight (a 30+ page digital format magazine I publish here in Australia) for an example of the ad. http://www.appleusers.org/magazine/february-2010-issue-of-appleusers-spotlight-now-available/ The 'electronic' copy of the flyer has each user group name as an active hyperlink, so people can jump straight to a group in their state. If it appeared in a printed magazine or flyer, then there is still the simple URL that can easily be typed in which lands you at a page with links to the various groups own webpages. The 'primary' URL used on the flyer was actually put to a vote and everyone agreed that we wouldn't use the www.apple.com/au/usergroup link (or even the www.apple.com.au/usergroup one) as quite a few of the 'active' groups here have chosen NOT to be listed there - so they can be seen as been independent from Apple (and any other retailer) and also due to the fact that listing often falls out of date. I just realised that the ad needs updating - we don't mention the iPad in the current version :) We also have a portrait version on hand if we need it... in fact, the flyer started out as an A4 size portrait flyer when we were approached to have an ad in one of Australian Macworld's Super Guide publications - unfortunately we couldn't arrange enough funding to go ahead with the idea in the time frame at hand... but now we have a solid basis to work from the next time an opportunity presents itself There is nothing stopping a group of User Groups in a 'state', 'region' or 'area' from getting together and producing their own version of such an ad. I also love what Mac Users UK have done with their Google map showing the location of each User Group in the UK (and Ireland) http://www.macusersuk.org/mugs/mugsmap.php I really must work out how to create such a Map for Australian User Groups :) > Let me make an analogy...

Actually, most 'concerts' and major events organisers discourage 'hawkers' from 'hassling' people at the gates/entrance... but they'll quite happily take your groups money and let you have a concession stand near by (and usually take a percentage of your gross takings as well) And why should Apple be expected do the marketing for independent User Groups??? Yes, I know User Groups 'promote' Apple products... but we have chosen to do so... we aren't compelled to do so. We come together in User Groups (or even in online communities such as this) to meet with like minded people and discuss things about a common topic of interest to us... just like there are groups that get together as book clubs, or reptile keepers, even ""gunzels"" get together through their common interest in trains (real ones and model ones). No one makes them form these groups nor force people to participate... and most other 'hobbies' aren't so (un)fortunate to have a 'central' business or entity to focus around, yet they survive and even flourish all by themselves. > Chris -- Nicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org) Founder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org http://www.appleusers.org/ _______________________________________________ Do not post admin requests to the list.

ham,"EPA Stunned: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause CancerGlad they finally figured this one out... Note the very careful wording, so exhaust may be beneficial to ones health as long as you have a glass a day with some cheese. Interesting timing, since 16,000 truckers just lost their jobs and dont have to worry about death from this anymore. - Adam L. ""Duncan"" Beberg http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/ beberg@mithral.com -------- EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study. The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content. While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer risk to humans. ""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and uncertainties are involved."" The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel emissions under the Clean Air Act. Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel. EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval, the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines. The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road, although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel is expected to produce pollution reductions. The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when gauging pollution health concerns. But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of cancer risk to an individual. Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to environmental exposure."" The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a ""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said. Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment. Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent standards for diesel construction and farm equipment."" Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times cleaner than just a dozen years ago."" The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.

No that is appropriate content for the file. I'm not a C programmer, but I think that these sort of things (#include ) are instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions e.g. ""#include "" gives you maths type functions. Since they start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation. Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4 which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4). This might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers. I think this is the right way to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversions.h & Co. I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below. First of all you will move modversions.h (which you have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h) files. This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files don't really belong there). For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful compilation. m > > Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed > that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h > file.

The main way that spammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers, but by sending through open proxy servers. It used to be that spammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the originating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists, and the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many ISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers. One would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE, and mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a fairly good indication of spam.

ham,"Canadians again - something a little more substantivePoliticians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool for fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole 'anonymity' thing. Also I notice this story shows the truth - the Canadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just a branch office. Come to think of it, the last story I posted about Canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military HQ in Palm Beach, Florida.' Owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . *Will Canada's ISPs become spies?* By Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html *WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies.* A discussion draft released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online. The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice and Industry Canada , wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in early 2003. Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty , which the country is in the process of considering. If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In most circumstances, a court order would be required for government agents to conduct Internet monitoring. Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty , which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted , or ratified, the treaty. Michael Geist , a professor at the University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems weak. ""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, make that case."" Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems."" Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , but it applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies. ""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment. Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data."" EPIC opposes the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights. Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" the draft says. Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea."" ""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet anonymously,"" Hosein said. A representative for George Radwanski , Canada's privacy commissioner, said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on the paper as it stands."" Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca no later than Nov. 15. "

ham,"Lindows.com: Michael's Minute: Lindows.com Report CardFrom nobody Mon Mar 5 10:42:14 2018 Content-Type: text/plain; 	charset=""us-ascii"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit If this message is not displaying properly, click here to launch it in your browser. Michael's Minute: Lindows.com Report Card As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their report cards. I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation.. To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here . Operating System: As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks. For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80% of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone. Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart computers are certified, ensuring that all components work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade: B _____ Software: Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A- _____ Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice . Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas. Grade: B _____ Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid. Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths Grade: B+ _____ Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer! LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com Builder partners. The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware. The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs.

ham,"My Good EasyURL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/07.html#my_good_easy Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00 _Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", ""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus (as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", ""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete ""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them (mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the window. In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My _emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is my single most backed-up possession. Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI [16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].

ham,"[ILUG] PPPD disconnects on me!Hello folks! I'm new to Linux, so here goes... I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem. I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18. I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver for it. Minicom is very much able to dial out. But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation. When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal. Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat. I used this command: pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script somewhere). It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits. This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial port using pppd to connect ttyS0. I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited. Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc. It'd be nice never have to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

ham,"I was such an ugly baby... Forwarded-by: Chris Wedgwood From: Bert 01. I was so poor growing up... if I wasn't a boy... I'd have had nothing to play with. 02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, ""Come on over; nobody's home."" I went over. Nobody was home. 03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me. Just the other night she called me from a hotel 04. One day I came home early from work... I saw a guy jogging naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy, why are you doing that?"" He said ""Because you came home early."" 05. It's been a rough day. I got up this morning... put a shirt on and button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, and the handle came off. I'm afraid to go to the bathroom. 06. I was such an ugly kid... When I played in the sandbox, the cat kept covering me up. 07. I could tell my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and radio. 08. I was such an ugly baby... My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend. 09. I'm so ugly... My father carries around a picture of the kid who came with his wallet. 10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to my father, ""I'm sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled through."" 11. I'm so ugly... My mother had morning sickness... AFTER I was born. 12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof. 13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find them?"" He said,""I don't know kid. There's so many places they can hide."" 14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday. 15. I'm so ugly... I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how big I'd get. 16. I went to see my doctor. ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and I look in the mirror... I feel like throwing up; What's wrong with me?"" He said... ""I don't know but your eyesight is perfect."" 17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest. 18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, ""How can I get my kite in the air?"" He told me to run off a cliff. 19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm. Last night he went on the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it. 20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control. 21. My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in the electric chair. "
ham,"[ILUG] VPN implementationI need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE. It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is somewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only. So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ? If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

Topics covered in this issue include: * DebConf10 update * Squeeze freeze * Debian-Ubuntu relationship * Debian installation media and non-free firmware * ... and much more. DebConf10 update ---------------- Deadlines are looming for DebConf10 - some have already passed. For example, the last day to submit a BoF (Birds of a Feather) talk has come and gone. There is still lots you can do for DebConf10 however including volunteering time, lending equipment, and even donating money. Sponsors and donors are needed to help defray the costs of holding DebConf10 as Raphael Geissert wrote on his blog [6]. 6 : http://my.opera.com/atomo64/blog/2010/05/04/debconf10-needs-your-help Joey Hess also blogged about DebConf10 [7] saying ""Let us get you to DebConf -- I promise you won't regret it!"" There is still time (you have until the 15th of May) to contact Joey about this year's special funding to get you to DebConf10. 7 : http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/Sponsoring_non-regulars_for_DebConf10/ Squeeze freeze -------------- Adam Barratt and the release team sent out an update on the status of transitions, Release Critical bugs and a Timeline of the Squeeze freeze. In short, we have a way to go before Squeeze is frozen and it is difficult for the release team to estimate when Squeeze will get frozen. Adam writes ""In order to help us keep a clearer picture of which changes still need to occur before we can freeze, we will be introducing a 'transition freeze' before the end of this month. If you have not yet discussed your transition with the Release Team, please ensure that you have done so before May 21st."" The release team is already working on some transitions now, like Qt4 and gnome-desktop, which are finished. The KDE team is working on KDE 4.4 with the goal of having as up-to-date and stable version of the KDE suite as is possible. To quote Adam: ""We're also close to completing the evince / totem-pl-parser transition, which means we're well on the way to have GNOME 2.30 in Squeeze."" ""Even though the descending slope of theRC bug graph [8] is pretty impressive [2], we still have about 400 RC bugs in Squeeze. Some of them are waiting for packages to transition from unstable to testing, but there's still a large number which need working on. On this every DD can help out by NMUing packages which are currently affected by RC bugs. Please remember that releasing is a collective effort and it is not enough to just have your own packages RC-bug free (although it's a good start) to be able to release. So, if you can help, please choose an RC bug [9], fix it :-) and NMU it, possibly to the DELAYED queue so that the maintainer can react if needed."" 8 : http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/ 9 : http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/debian/all.html Debian-Ubuntu relationship -------------------------- Being invited to the recent Ubuntu Developer Summit, Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli gathered feedback [10] and examples about the relationship between the two projects. Most interesting where of course success stories, ""epic fails"" and requests from the Debian Project at large to the Ubuntu community. Later he posted a link to his slided [11] (a video is also available [12]) also containing some figures, e.g. that roughly 75% of all packages in Ubuntu are taken without further patches directly from Debian. Stefano later posted a summary of his talk [13] and the feedback he got. 10 : http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2010/05/msg00083.html 11 : http://upsilon.cc/~zack/stuff/debian-uds-m.pdf 12 : http://blip.tv/file/3622104 13 : http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2010/05/msg00084.html Debian installation media and non-free firmware ----------------------------------------------- With Debian's Kernel Team moving firmware files (binary data needed for some hardware like network interface cards) in separate packages in Debian's non-free section, Kurt Roeckx wondered [14], if that approach could lead to usage problems especially during installation and if these files should be added to the installation media. Several people pointed out, that the debian installation system already supports loading firmware [15] from a separate installation media, e.g. a USB stick. That however would still be to complicate for many users or use cases (e.g. remote installation). In the end Steve Langasek proposed [16] to offer normal installation media without non-free firmware files and an easy to use tool, which would add the distributable non-free firmware files to the installation media image. 14 : http://lists.debian.org/20100505162955.GA17250@roeckx.be 15 : http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/ch06s04.html 16 : http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2010/05/msg00081.html Other news ---------- The 22nd issue of the miscellaneous news for developers [17] has been released and covers the following topics: 17 : http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/05/msg00006.html * LWN subscriptions * ubuntudiff.debian.net * TXT records on debian.net * Debian Sysadmin Team seeks for help * Receive Ubuntu bugs by mail via PTS mips* porter Andreas Barth gave a status update [18] about the mips and mipsel ports [19]. While the situation for mipsel have been improved dramatically, the situation for mips remains unchanged [20]. 18 : http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/05/msg00005.html 19 : http://www.debian.org/ports/mips/ 20 : http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/04/msg00010.html Debian System Administrator Martin Zobel-Helas announced [21] a new version of the ""Debian Machine Usage Policies"" becoming effective on July 04th, 2010. The DMUP basically covers what Debian Developers may or may not do with their accounts on debian.org hardware. The change was necessary to clarify responsibilities between the Debian System Administrators and the Debian Account Managers. 21 : http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/05/msg00001.html Debian New Maintainer Frontdesk Member Enrico Zini reminded [22] Developers on how to properly advocate applicants for the new maintainer process.

(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases. (b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes. (c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf membership. (d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert. (e) all of the above. ""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, the military has launched a raid on your wallet."" The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 billion in goods and services, the audit found. In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found. ""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even imagine."" Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted. Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, so taxpayers may end up paying the tab. ""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said. ""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, instead of offending the taxpayer."" -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: 2.6.2 iQCVAwUBPUA6FdCSe1KnQG7RAQGAKwP/Zpfw0Uq3BPLnXXmnlWQ2aFFb1FSaj+nJ QOMt9q4TBhiYJhIdgdd+uGxoubiPfvyIweSR1PjOdoFe8dYf2h/V4gNS9hSmkSgC 76RZVuitNf2DbEsaY8TtcUDLDC51m/jgxiGcgPkcyJ+0Wn11RRbktkVEefSNTaBz M8ibVFiDPyI= =9fYc -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Libertarian Party http://www.lp.org/ 2600 Virginia Ave. NW, Suite 100 voice: 202-333-0008 Washington DC 20037 fax: 202-333-0072 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- For subscription changes, please use the WWW form at: http://www.lp.org/action/email.html "

Needless to > say, it'll be a bit difficult to bring it back to the shop once I'm home > in Dublin and find it doesn't work! Any monitor should just work - they all have VGA connectors and any half decent brand will be know about by XFree setup programs in modern distributions. However, if you have the budget (insurance paying for the dead monitor, perhaps ? - and WHERE was your monitor that it got caught in a flood ?) getting a monitor with a DVI input is best. Of course, you'll need a DVI out video card then, too. DVI provides a much better picture than VGA because it removes the analog stage - basically DVI gives you a direct connection from video ram pixels to monitor pixels - the best pictures I've ever seen on a computer is on my notebook screen at 1400x1050 (which doesn't use DVI, but an internal connection which has the same effect). Brand wise, I like Iiyama a lot and I think they may have a Europe wide warranty.

Maybe we can lower FPs a bit more. :-) I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can achieve. Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't factored in to the GA scores. The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as time goes on. The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 2.41 or 2.50 branches.

The issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and liable to be forged to generate FNs.

ham,"Setting up Java1.6 on OS 10.5Hi all, I'm trying to get Java1.6 working on my MacBook Pro 1,1 which has 10.5.8 on it. I've downloaded a package from the OpenJDK project, and I've got it setup using the directions that I've found at the bottom of this thread: http://www.mailarky.com/thread.php?page=1&id=197627 where I've setup an OpenJDK6.jar folder in my ~/Library/Java/ JavaVirtualMachines directory. I've got the proper directory structure, but no luck in having it recognized by the /usr/libexec/java_home function. Nor is it recognized if I try to symlink it as a the 1.6.0 folder in the /System/Library/.../Versions path. I think then the culprit may be my Info.plist file. Does anyone have any experience with doing this setup? I've included what my Info.plist looks like below to see if it's not formatted properly.

Is there an objective explanation to this? I'd had similar problem with Iceweasel on Lenny when my browser cache limit was set to a large value. But things are okay after bringing it down (to 20MB). You might want to try that. Large cache slows Iceweasel down because it uses these large databases of stored history to suggest addresses in each tab's address bar.

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is done for the benefit of, companies based in the US. The spam often appears to originate there because it's coming from open http, or squid proxy servers. It's hosted there because these spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs. One hardly needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US citizen is violating US law. > - Law suits take time.

Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to the news media. If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've heard of PopLaunch, right?) > - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst. Seems she had an open file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude photos: http://belps.freewebsites.com/ I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in confirming the validity of the information found online. There were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC released the following: http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.

The most powerful of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.

The current situation is: Volatile has clamav 0.95, while upstream has 0.96. There are security related issues in 0.95 (DoS etc.?) [1] that might affect(?) volatile - futhermore the clamav-people are suggesting to use the latest version [2] - that is 0.96. Volatile itself is not supported by the security team [3] and the security team refuses the support the current stable version [4]. As a sysop running lenny/clamav on a few hosts, I started building clamav from source and reading clamav's announce list. But I wonder, what does it mean in the long run: - Will volatile be updated to 0.96 soon? - Will clamav (in volatile) receive official security support? - Are there any (better supported) alternatives to clamav in lenny? - Afair there is no specific EOL-/Kill-Switch in clamav: ClamAV <= 0.94 is unable to handle ""big"" incremental updates and a ""too"" big update was shipped. Is it - from a naive point of view - just a bug that can be fixed in debian [5]? Just apply the given patch [6] in lenny's clamav and be happy? ;-) Thanks, Keep smiling yanosz [1] http://git.clamav.net/gitweb?p=clamav-devel.git;a=blob_plain;f=ChangeLog;hb=clamav-0.95.3 [2] http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/2009/10/05/eol-clamav-094/ [3] http://www.debian.org/volatile/index.en.html [4] http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2009/msg00228.html [5] https://wwws.clamav.net/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1395 [6] https://wwws.clamav.net/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1395#c12 -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-security-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

No dumping tea in the harbour or anything like that. I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on television, and that the tactics can be justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand, it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and the protestors were not in anybody's face (at least in my understanding of the vernacular). And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and writing checks is beyond many of us. Owen "

As per the above link, it seems not all the specs have been released or made publicly available. There are also some concerns about software patents (for using -and distributing- MP3 codecs or FLV).

The current version of the Limbo beta is 7.3.93 (yeah, they should have renamed it, but they didn't). It's in the same redhat/linux/beta/limbo directory on the ftp servers. Just check the redhat-release package to find out which version is on the server. Looking at ftp.redhat.com, the current one is redhat-release-7.3.93-2. If you're using GNOME2 from the beta, I'd upgrade as there were some important bugfixes since the first beta. The only thing to watch out for is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again incompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1). gary _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list "

Hmm - I've been using MH for a long time (since well before there were sequences) and I don't think I've ever seen a ""pseq"" ...

I've always used ""sel"" for that purpose. I kind of doubt that any pre built-in sequence name is going to be very general.

ham,"Dan Gillmor responds to Jack ValentiURL: http://boingboing.net/#85506950 Date: Not supplied Dan Gillmor interviewed Jack Valenti[1] last week in his column and did the impartial thing, representing Valenti's beliefs as fairly as possible. This week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda really entails: So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used to violate copyrights. Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. Saying it doesn't make it so.

A neighbor at one point had a 4 or 5 year old that would choke on jello, probably because she never allowed him to have solid food until he was far too old, IMHO.

Couldn't have put it better myself, but that's not going to stop me trying :-) The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more the files ""real"" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

This isn't particularly well-founded logic. What you're saying is that ""most rich people are smart"" and that the latter is causal to the former. By implication, then, you would say that ""most poor people are stupid"". This is true, statistically, because most people are poor and most people are also stupid. However there's nothing to indicate a causal link there. So being smart isn't the only mechanical requirement to eternal wealth because, obviously, most of the members of this list would be rich. Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and respected, but he's not particularly rich. Jennifer Lopez is by all accounts a complete moron. In fact, spend a weekend in Beverly Hills and you will encounter vast numbers of people who are profoundly stupid driving Rolls Royces and shopping at PRADA. The working class IS the market and the working class IS where wealth is created. The working class makes long-distance calls, buys food processors and computers and clothes, and attaches the value to goods which allows them to be commodified. The working class saves money, buys Retirement Savings Plans, and invests in mutual funds which increases the flow of capital through the investment funnel. The economic system of the first world is designed to strike a delicate balance between incentivizing the ruling class to support wealth-expanding through technological innovation or the development of new markets. At the 100,000 foot level, recessions and depressions are created when more wealth is sucked from the whirlpool than can be supported by the working class through investment and consumption. And the people draining the hot tub are the folks in the ruling class -- people like Ken Lay, Dick Cheney, Bernie Ebbers, et al -- and they simply got too greedy and caused a bubble in the hydraulics that increased the pressure for a time, but ultimately wasn't sustainable. And the money that was lost did not come from the ruling class. It came from the RSP's and the Equity funds and the Investments of individual working class -- people who believed these reports and invested. The wealth of the ruling class was largely pulled out by the time such investments were exposed to the workers. So, is the lower caste necessarily stupid for saving money or investing in retirement plans? I don't think so. Are they stupid for buying clothes and automobiles? I don't think so. At the granular level, the notion that ""most rich people are rich because they're smart"" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not worth arguing about, so I won't. Still, a compelling point worth some clarification. -Ian. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork "

I reran the experiment (with the new SpamHam1.pik, but it doesn't seem to make a difference). Here are the clues for the two spams in my inbox (in hammie.py's output format, which sorts the clues by probability; the first two numbers are the message number and overall probability; then line-folded): 66 1.00 S 'facility': 0.01; 'speaker': 0.01; 'stretch': 0.01; 'thursday': 0.01; 'young,': 0.01; 'mistakes': 0.12; 'growth': 0.85; '>content-type:text/plain': 0.85; 'please': 0.85; 'capital': 0.92; 'series': 0.92; 'subject:Don': 0.94; 'companies': 0.96; '>content-type:text/html': 0.96; 'fee': 0.96; 'money': 0.96; '8:00am': 0.99; '9:00am': 0.99; '>content-type:image/gif': 0.99; '>content-type:multipart/alternative': 0.99; 'attend': 0.99; 'companies,': 0.99; 'content-type/type:multipart/alternative': 0.99; 'content-type:multipart/related': 0.99; 'economy': 0.99; 'economy""': 0.99 This has 6 content-types as spam clues, only one of which is related to HTML, despite there being an HTML alternative (and 12 other spam clues, vs. only 6 ham clues). This was an announcement of a public event by our building owners, with a text part that was the same as the HTML (AFAICT). Its language may be spammish, but the content-type clues didn't help. (BTW, it makes me wonder about the wisdom of keeping punctuation -- 'economy' and 'economy""' to me don't seem to deserve two be counted as clues.) 76 1.00 S '(near': 0.01; 'alexandria': 0.01; 'conn': 0.01; 'from:adam': 0.01; 'from:email addr:panix': 0.01; 'poked': 0.01; 'thorugh': 0.01; 'though': 0.03; ""i'm"": 0.03; 'reflect': 0.05; ""i've"": 0.06; 'wednesday': 0.07; 'content-disposition:inline': 0.10; 'contacting': 0.93; 'sold': 0.96; 'financially': 0.98; 'prices': 0.98; 'rates': 0.99; 'discount.': 0.99; 'hotel': 0.99; 'hotels': 0.99; 'hotels.': 0.99; 'nights,': 0.99; 'plaza': 0.99; 'rates,': 0.99; 'rates.': 0.99; 'rooms': 0.99; 'season': 0.99; 'stations': 0.99; 'subject:Hotel': 0.99 Here is the full message (Received: headers stripped), with apologies to Ziggy and David: """""" Date: Fri, 06 Sep 2002 17:17:13 -0400 From: Adam Turoff Subject: Hotel information To: guido@python.org, davida@activestate.com Message-id: MIME-version: 1.0 Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Content-disposition: inline User-Agent: Mutt/1.4i I've been looking into hotels. I poked around expedia for availability from March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday). I've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group rates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a contract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially responsible for unbooked rooms). Most hotels are less than responsive...

Also, I'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only discount. I can't vouch for any of these hotels, either. I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through mid-september, and mid-november through mid-january. Z. """""" This one has no MIME structure nor HTML! It even has a Content-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue. It got f-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related terms. I'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.

The first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-). It has lots of HTML clues that are apparently ignored. It was a multipart/mixed with two parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, a mondo weird URL: http://x60.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=687715863&CONTEXT=973121507.1408827441&hitnum=23 and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part was the HTML taken directly from the above URL.

ham,"Trip NotesURL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000647 Date: 2002-10-08T16:39:48-06:00 === Scissors === I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever terrorists. *Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert. === Waiting for Wireless === Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, you know)--I doubt they will accept it. === Irony === According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his flight. I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing these airline announcements keep me up to date. === Automatic Flush Toilets === Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three times. This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web site. === Arrival === I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now for the meetings and parties. Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-) "

ham,"California needs intelligent energy deregulation --- begin forwarded text Status: RO Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 13:57:15 -0400 To: Digital Bearer Settlement List From: ""R. A. Hettinga"" Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp Posted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation By Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology Columnist The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California. Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes. The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices. And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.'' How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient. More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources. If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles. State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org). It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market. We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential. But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both. The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner. But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough. The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace. Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether. Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly. It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year. -- ----------------- R. A.

It might just be me, but when I head ""USB-serial adaptor"" I think of something like a PL2303 which can be used to attach devices with a serial connector to a PC that lacks a serial port. It would be news to me if these adaptors worked the other way round, too. But if it actually works, you should be able to talk to the device using the regular /dev/ttyS0.

ham,"Apple: Heinous DVD PiratesURL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000644 Date: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00 DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many ways encouraged. *Tools:* 1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work) 1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work) 1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" *Process:* 1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for you. 2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to your hard drive. Ejct the DVD. 3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that Disney has released such a major movie without encryption. "

Looney mentioned: > This is likely because to get it to boot, like the cobalt, I'm actually > passing root=/dev/hda5 to the kernel, not /dev/md0. Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it would barf with 'can't find init'. It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on the new rootfs. When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked. Woohoo.

ham,"RE: Goodbye Global Warming> ""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, is > highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological > timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate. There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations. The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale. > It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited > during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of > humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers > paved over their civilization.

I don't see any compelling reason to ""save > the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their > existence has always been transient. Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on global human activity. > For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are > anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another. I'll > just stick with Occam's Razor for now. The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity. It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2 concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident as heat. - Jim "

The file was a quicktime .mov file they made with their own camera and is on their machine so unfortunately I cannot get a snippet of it. FWIW, I did 2 fresh Lenny installs on my friend's machine, the first one with debian-multimedia which resulted in the .mov file not playing back in mplayer, and a subsequent second Lenny install, identical to the first except without the debian-multimedia, in which the .mov file played great in mplayer. I don't know if it's a bug or not, but has anyone else had this specific problem (with .mov files in mplayer)? If so I will gladly file the bug report.

The upcoming version, the company's first major update of the product since releasing Exchange 2000 nearly two years ago, will by default disable certain messaging features to prevent hackers and virus makers from taking advantage of openings. While Microsoft's biggest nemesis in the e-mail and messaging market is Lotus , the company also competes against Novell and newcomer Oracle , which plans to release its own e-mail and messaging software later this year.

Big Blue has fixed many early Shark problems, improving everything from data transfer capabilities to cache size, and adding RAID 10 support and Eliza self-healing features. But IBM faces the still dominant EMC , which last week lured away Mark Lewis from HP to become its new CTO; and Hitachi , which still boasts the technology edge. IBM's edge is its ability to bundle Shark sales with related server and service deals.

I bought it seperately but it's also Software originally belonging to a laptop but a different model than my own. Maybe this might play a role, but i'm far away from being an expert in this items. One can read on some Linux websites which deal with this energy saving problem, that it makes no sense anyway to change, for example, your cpu state in order to save battery power, i.e. that it is useless to choose the mode ""powersave"" or ""conservative"" for saving power. On the other side. it is likewise useless to choose the mode ""performance"" to tune your cpu efficiency. For me this makes sense. Modern cpu's are flexible enough to quickly change between ""low"" and ""performance"" if needed. Modern notebook hdd's are likewise already optimized for energy saving modes. But something must be different between windows and linux. Using my windows there is indeed a different if i would set the power management to ""performance"" or to ""powersave"". This makes nearly an hour or a half difference in battery lifetime of my multiboot laptop! Of course this drepends on what you do, but the difference is obvious. Using my Debian i seldom reach a larger time span as if using windows in ""performance"" mode, in spite of it is so ""quiet"" when working with it or when idle, and windows always is so ""restless"" as if always something happens on the disk, some processes are running etc. Maybe this after all has something to do with the different kernels?

While Central America may have had 20 or 30 million, vast areas of South America were uninhabited and other places very sparsely e.g., the plains Indians in what is now the U.S. may have been 2 million or so. There are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from 20 something million to circa 8 or 10 million in the 16th century, certainly, in part due to infectious diseases new and old, and other factors, and was probably in decline before contact. Others claim it declined from 80-ish million to 3 or 4 million and somehow deduce 95% mortality from imported diseases, and have a pretty clear agenda which makes me (for one) take their claims with a large grain of salt. About all that is certain is that anyone alive in 1500 was dead in 1600, in the Americas or elsewhere. R http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork "

Seems like every CD player should include the capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs inserted. Playback would then never need to face seek delays... after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted -- which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at- first-track operation. You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"". Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of some sort... and the player recognizes it from the silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would start immediately. - Gordon "

ham,"[SOLVED] Re: NVidia MCP61, no sound...Dear Anand,=20 I tried your configuration file, but nothing changed. For all of you who were so kind to try to help me, here are some good news: I tried to install kernel 2.6.32 from lenny backports and the sound seems to work now. At least I could here the ""login.wav"" that most Lenny users know. The bad part is that now I cannot make the graphics card to work, because I should recompile the NVidia driver, but to accomplish this task I need linux-headers-$(uname -r), and this package depend on the corresponding linux-kbuild, which won't install, according to apt-get message. This is a pity, but at least now I'm sure the sound card is working. My PC is brand new, so I'm happy it's not a hardware problem, even though it's still a problem. So I would say the issue is solved, from my point of view. I won't ask some help to force the installation of linux-headers in this thread, maybe I'll start another one. Many many thanks to everyone!

ham,"Debian-style task-packages for RH8.0 availableHi, This has been hashed over a few times on various lists, now I finally got around to doing something about it... You can now add ""rpm http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/ redhat/8.0 task"" to your sources.list and after apt-get update you can find out what's available with 'apt-cache search ^task-' These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by running http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py. BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an apt-enabled mirror of RH8.0 in your sources.list to actually do anything with it. -- 	- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list "

No that is appropriate content for the file. I'm not a C programmer, but I think that these sort of things (#include ) are instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions e.g. ""#include "" gives you maths type functions. Since they start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation. Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4 which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4). This might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers. I think this is the right way to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversions.h & Co. I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below. First of all you will move modversions.h (which you have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h) files. This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files don't really belong there). For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful compilation. m > > Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed > that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h > file.

A. Hettinga"" Bob, This guy's an idiot. I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors. One of those has 864 of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules each. They weigh 125 kg. You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked maximizes that. It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles. You also need voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them arranged in series to boost the voltage. Ignore him. He's a waste of my time. ------------------------ From: ""R. A. Hettinga"" Subject: Re: Electric car an Edsel...

Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like 1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42. (the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW) Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve. But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design. - Adam L.

spam,"Judicial Judgements-Child Support BGS xXxX= xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX Thank you for your interest! Judgment Courses offers an extensive training course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments"" If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments can earn you very substantial income . If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a Money Judgment against them. You are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact: &quot;Its now up to you to collect on the Judgment&quot;. The court does not require the loser to pay you. The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found. The result is that millions of Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten. &quot;In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a dime.&quot; The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions. Right now in the United States there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more Judgments take its place. We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed. With our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing Money Judgments. By following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of Money Judgments. The income potential is substantial in this profession. We have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices. Today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates. Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies, police officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us for reports. Many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars. Legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10% interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments. Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to $500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the payment of the principal. Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per year. This is just for interest, not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income. Typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars. 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43% are women and 36% are part time . One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are working on will be there when you return. The Judgments are still in force, they do not disappear. The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you are. You are not a collection agency. Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing are as follows: Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who to write to) 8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them unless you want to. You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and 50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for $2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00. You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you. They range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc. The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to 1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge $6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $25.00. Once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located. (Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course) When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to the original Judgment holder. Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of Judgment to the court. (Included in the course) Quote's from several of our students: Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your professionalism in both the manual and your support. You have the video opened doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on"" After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in judgments I am collecting on now"" After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated ""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I will have to hire someone to help out"" Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months"" >From the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following: With our course you can own your own successful business. A business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to retire on and travel the world. A business which is extremely interesting to be in.

spam,"EUOK reports share alert euok draft 1 1 Hi Every one, For all our new members welcome. &nbsp; We are pleased and excited to release our latest pick Euoko Group Inc , trading symbol EUOK . &nbsp; EUOK is an elite manufacturer of luxury based beauty products, with a focus in anti aging and wrinkle prevention. &nbsp; EUOK gross profit has grown by 102% for the three months ended January 31, 2010 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2009. Gross profit margin for the three months ended was 81% .&nbsp; Sales increased by 88% for the three months ended January 31, 2010 when compared to the same period in the prior year. &nbsp; EUOK gross profit has grown by 57% for the six months ended January 31, 2010 compared to the six months ended January 31, 2009. Gross profit margin for the six months ended was 79%.&nbsp; Sales increased by 49% for the six months ended January 31, 2010 when compared to the same period in the prior year. &nbsp; When benchmarked against its industry competitors Revlon (REV:NYSE) , Estee Lauder (EL:NYSE), Shiseido , and LVMH ( Euronext: MC) , EUOK has had significantly more sales growth when compared to the same period in the prior year.&nbsp; &nbsp; Company Name Sales Growth (3 months ended Q1 2010 compared to 3 months ended Q1 2009) Increase/(Decrease) EUOK 88% Estee Lauder Companies 10% Revlon 0.73% Shiseido (6.7%) LVMH 11% &nbsp; &nbsp; The growth in sales is primarily due to the EUOK brand becoming more established in the premium cosmetic channels.&nbsp; &nbsp; EUOK current trading price of 0.40 is a steal. We have been following the cosmetics and beauty industry now for quite some time. According to Forbes.com who did an article on the growth of the cosmetics industry, beauty products generate nearly 230 billion annually in global sales , with a consumer preference placed on products that are high tech and natural based (favoring companies like EUOK ). With the current status of the company, EUOK is poised to grab no less than 1% of global sales, ensuring 230 million in gross sales for EUOK . Based off revenue alone that would warrant a $6.57 share price . &nbsp; The financials speak for themselves; EUOK is set to make a run and is extremely undervalued. &nbsp; In the past , large multinational corporations have dominated the market place, but in recent years boutique brands such as EUOK have been at the fore front of consumer spending. EUOK is ready to take full advantage of this. Data released from the NPD Group (a marketing info company based in New York) says luxury cosmetics have grown at an annual rate of 4% - 7% since 2002 . Estee lauder and L’Oreal have realized this and have been acquiring companies like EUOK in order to meet the demand of consumers. There are several reasons behind the growth in high-end cosmetics: the expansion of new markets in Russia and Asia; changing social norms that make using cosmetics--not to mention undergoing cosmetic surgery--more acceptable; celebrity worship; promotion within fashion magazines; improvements in the technology that creates makeup; the influence of mass retailers that can offer lower prices, and raising affluence. As cosmetics becomes less expensive, better and more accessible, more affluent women--and increasingly men as well--have moved away from older brands of makeup and skincare in search of higher-quality new products and more exclusivity. EUOK recognizes this and has gained retail distribution worldwide through its relationships with department store retail giants such as Barneys New York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Bliss, Harrods (London), Printemps (France), La Rinascente (Italy) and Lane Crawford (Hong Kong) . Upper management of EUOK has a three prong approach to further drive global brand recognition: &nbsp; North America &nbsp; EUOK strategy in North America is one of strong luxury brand positioning through partnerships with premier department stores and flagship locations. EUOK department store partners include Bergdorf Goodman in New York City, Barneys New York nationwide, Ogilvy, as well as boutique-style department stores across USA and Canada. EUOK also operates brand-owned flagship stores in Toronto and Vancouver. EUOK subsidiary, Hewitt-Vevey, is positioned in medical facilities and online, with p lans to grow in both directions. Future expansion plans include creating new partnerships with other major department stores, as well as positioning with 5-star hotels in key markets.&nbsp; &nbsp; Europe &nbsp; EUOK distribution in Europe varies by market but is restricted to luxury channels that position the brand amongst the leading luxury skincare brands. Our representation includes department stores and perfumeries in major markets. These channels include Printemps in France, Harrods and Liberty in the UK, La Rinascente in Italy, as well as perfumeries in other countries. Expansion plans for Europe are focused primarily in the UK and France with negotiations with premier department stores under way.&nbsp; &nbsp; Asia&nbsp; EUOK distribution in Asia varies by country for best positioning amongst the leading luxury brands. Our major department store partner in Hong Kong is Lane Crawford, as well as Joyce. We are also represented through luxury perfumeries and spas in Singapore and South Eastern China. Asia represents our largest immediate growth potential. We are in communication with major department stores and distributors in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other major markets in China. We expect new accounts for EUOK , as well as major interest in WhiteRX, an upcoming product of our subsidiary, Hewitt-Vevey, to drive significant growth in Asia. We are also in communication with major retailers in the Middle East and Russia, two high-potential markets in which we are not yet present. &nbsp; &nbsp; Corporate Summary &nbsp; With confidence, we welcome you to Euoko, an exclusive brand that represents the cornerstone of the most innovative, most unique skin treatments. Euoko indeed stands at the intersection of the most noble of commitments to effective a ctive technology, unsurpassed delivery systems, uncompromised service and a modern, understated image. &nbsp; Our constantly growing library of active principles currently exhibits 102 ingredients from Switzerland, Spain, France, Canada, Denmark, the United States, the Amazonian Rainforest, the Kalahari Desert and Denmark. From our most unique hyaluronic acid with no animal origins or strepp bacteria derivatives to our recent addition of an extraordinarily effective, age-killing peptide that fully mimics Waglerin 1, a peptide that is found in the venom of the Temple Viper, Tropidolaemus wagleri, we stand strongly behind the innovative collection of the noble ingredients found in our products. Both the safety and effectiveness of our ingredients are important to us. We avoid unnecessary preservation or stabilization and respond rapidly to emerging innovations in biotechnology, nanotechnology, biology, peptides and other active principles. &nbsp; Further, our proprietary delivery system ensures maximum stability and absorption of our active principles into the skin. This delivery system is the single key catalyst that maximizes the effectiveness of our principles, while making it possible for high concentrations of our principles to be included synergistically in our formulations. Highlights of this system include a strain of red marine algae that maximizes penetration of actives into the skin by causing a controlled immune response when applied topically. This effect is enhanced by the delivery action of our micro-surfactants bound to a pure grade of hyaluronic acid, as well as our unique timed-release technology. Every Euoko product embodies Euoko’s commitment to science and quality. When you purchase a Euoko treatment, you stand confident that your purchase represents the latest scientific discoveries that are at the forefront of peptide-technology, nanotechnology, biotechnology and biology – a class of confidence unknown even in the highest class of skincare. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Disclosure This e-mail is a paid advertisement from a third party and not the company and is neither an offer nor recommendation to buy or sell any security.

If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all. I for one am GLAD that they a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some sort of autodetection and changing crap) b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because formats have changed. Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands of you, the maintainer of the machine.

I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box > with a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a > space computer with a large HD with much free space). You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough. You did put /home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the data as is. If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need to make backups. Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over ssh. It's the best way to make backups. > These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM!

ham,"[zzzzteana] Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defectedThe Electronic Telegraph Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected By Bruce Johnston in Rome (Filed: 28/08/2002) Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team. Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine, contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month. Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf. Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise. As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes. Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back, was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises. Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers from video footage. Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions. The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours. But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates. The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not grab their reins. The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods' boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states. The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Contents ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family. 2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl. 3. Beyond Words. 4. Q&A: Chip off the old block; Bells and whistles; Mortarboard. 5. Endnote. 6. Subscription commands. 7. Contact addresses. 1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family ------------------------------------------------------------------- Historically, families have usually had more children than parents, resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in recent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the number of children per generation has steadily gone down, while life span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree that some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin, with few people in each generation. The term ""beanpole family"" has been around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it rarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to wider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it too slangy and prefer the jargon term ""verticalised"" to describe such families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal relationships within the family and (for example) the role of grandparents. The rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the 'beanpole' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in divorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single child. [""Observer"", May 2002] Noting the rising number of so-called 'beanpole' families in Britain (families with only one child), the report warns that a child without siblings 'is starved of the companionship of family members of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation, with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life'. [""Guardian"", June 2002] 2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl ------------------------------------------------------------------- A stupid person, a blockhead. Unfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped out of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it that I can find is in the classic W C Fields film ""The Bank Dick"" of 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line: ""Surely, don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a jabbernow, you're not those, are you?"". Before that, it turns up in one of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems to have been rather rare. It's from the old French ""jobard"", from ""jobe"", silly. That word was then added to ""noll"", the top or crown of the head, the noddle. The first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within. ""Jobbernowlism"" is the condition or state of being a ""jobbernowl"", or an act or remark that is especially stupid. Careful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber! 3. Beyond Words ------------------------------------------------------------------- I've been away at a heritage conference in Colchester these past few days. On my way back, my eye was caught by this warning sign posted above some steps at the local railway station: Caution Do not run on the stairs Use the hand rail 4. Q&A ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q. For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer electronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come across the expression ""bells and whistles"", which seem to relate to equipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work. Is that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve Castelain, France] Q. You're right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to gimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function. The phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the American military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in an article in ""Atlantic"" in October 1982, which said it was ""Pentagon slang for extravagant frills"". There's some evidence that the term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early evidence is sparse. Where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth century, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before modern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud warning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam made the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the noisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans will agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at one time ""clang, clang, clang went the trolley"" in large numbers of American cities. At least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and whistles, as this extract from an article in ""Appleton's Journal"" of 1876 shows: You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and whistles seems like the small diversions of very little children, so diminished are they by the distance. Could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought excessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a frill? Possibly. But it's more probable the slang sense of the term comes from that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre organ. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to help the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns, sirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and organs often had ""toy counters"" with 20 or more noisemakers on them, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades after the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still common in big movie houses, these fun features must have been considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but mere fripperies, inessential add-ons. It's possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up especially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities to add them are so great. ----------- Q. The designation of ""robes"" for academic dress clearly comes from its origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about ""mortarboards""? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or 13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does ""mortarboard"" refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient? A. The academic cap often called a ""mortarboard"" is quite ancient, but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth century (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a ""square""). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually with a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts of mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually call it a hawk. What seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between the brickie's board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at Oxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our first recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, ""The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman"" by a clergyman named Edward Bradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names of the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school). Verdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book recounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don appears after one such escapade: ""I will overlook your offence in assuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave the offensive epithet of 'mortar-board'; more especially, as you acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have known better"". After a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more than 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley invented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly popularised it. ----------- Q. I got into a discussion about ""chip off the old block"" with friends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting, jewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this term mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan] A. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely made of wood. The first form of the expression was ""chip of the same block"", meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as somebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage. An early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time Bishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: ""Am not I a child of the same Adam ... a chip of the same block, with him?"". Later that century, another form is recorded ""a chip of the old block"", which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his father, or continued some family characteristic. At some point, probably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to ""a chip off the old block"", which does nothing to change the sense, but is the way it's now usually written or said. 5.

spam,"Apply for grant now --> He, old boy! you are forgetting Poniatowski's Red Lancers, the Cuirassiers, the Dragoons, and the whole boiling. Whenever Napoleon grew tired of seeing his battalions gain no ground towards the end of a victory, he would say to Murat, 'Here, you! cut them in two for me!' and we set out first at a trot, and then at a gallop, /one, two/! and cut a way clean through the ranks of the enemy; it was like slicing an apple in two with a knife. Why, a charge of cavalry is nothing more nor less than a column of cannon balls. No, no! Mrs. Mallet cried. To bring him back voluntarily, that he may face his trial like a man! Mr. Batchgrew, for the second time that morning unequal to a situation, turned foolishly to the wardrobe, clearing his throat and snorting. She took Madame Hulot's hand and before the lady could do anything to hinder her, she kissed it respectfully, even humbling herself to bend one knee. Then she rose, as proud as when she stood on the stage in the part of _Mathilde_, and rang the bell. 'Tis impossible! 'Tis a wild tale, though God knows I wish it were true, because he was a fine and gallant lad. Not a prank. "

ham,"[Razor-users] razor vs cloudmark - merging?I am somewhat puzzled by a phone call I (or rather the CIO at the ISP for whom I work) received from an individual claiming to represent Cloudmark. The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain information proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be required to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I was wondering if anyone else has received such a call? I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and the likes).

I'm skeptical. One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction is more ""real"" than the reality. You see it over and over again in history: The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive People are compelled to perpetuate. Worse, even when there is substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction that is already firmly entrenched. And many peoples (e.g. American Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth in popular culture. I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where you are on the planet. The only time you see any anomalies is when you have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com "

spam,"SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''. Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije. Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije. Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke. Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva. Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova. Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu. Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica. Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti. Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava. Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.

I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox. It is an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to avoid being tagged as spam. > Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself > on your installation.

I'm just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base. I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone's inbox) and after we've seen evidence that the system works, then we can increase the magnitude of the score.

ham,"Kill Your GodsHindus mourn 'monkey god' By Omer Farooq BBC reporter in Hyderabad Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers. The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles) south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday. It had not eaten for three weeks. Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman. Garlanded One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people. The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers. The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages, as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka. Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock. 'Exploited' Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents. But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated. They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple.

If it weren't for the live migration requirement, I read this to say that Google would be using XFS due to its superior performance: ""In a mailing list post, Google engineer Michael Rubin provided more insight into the decision-making process that led the company to adopt Ext4. The filesystem offered significant performance advantages over Ext2 _and nearly rivaled the high-performance XFS filesystem_ during the company's tests. Ext4 was ultimately chosen over XFS because it would allow Google to do a live in-place upgrade of its existing Ext2 filesystems."" -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

I can't really tell if it was my hacking that removed it, or if it was some transitional magic happening since this was the first invocation of that version of exmh. I've backed out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happens again. On another thing with the Ftoc_RescanLine stuff. This routine is called at times still unclar to me. An inspection of the routine suggests that it is used in the transition of a message to/form ""current"" state to re-paint the ftoc line. However, checking the msg.tcl code (MSgChange) we find: if {$msgid != {}} { # Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line instead if {$msgid < 0} return } else { # line null too, try using first in folder if {[string length $line] == 0} { set line 1 } set msgid [Ftoc_MsgNumber [Ftoc_FindMsg $msgid $line]] } Ftoc_ClearCurrent Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid Ftoc_ShowSequences $exmh(folder) The Ftoc_ClearCurrent calls Ftoc_RescanLIne to clear the '+' sign _before_ the on-disk transition is made. I hacked this stuff and more or less changed the order. It works, but fails on some folder changes. My feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a Ftoc_ClearCurrent, but rather just a RescanLine and the caller had better know the line or msgid. That routine shoud just put in the '+' if the line/msg in question happened to be the cur msg.

Nothing related to @synchronized. Your problem is that you are acquiring = an unretained pointer to an object, then doing something that releases = the object behind your back. number =3D [metadata objectForKey:key]; `number` now points to some object. Importantly, -objectForKey: just = hands back the pointer, without doing the [[result retain] autorelease] = dance. It's possible that the only thing that retained `number` is the = `metadata` dictionary. [metadata setValue:something forKey:key]; Now `metadata` has released `number`. It may be dead. You need to be careful with -objectForKey: and -objectAtIndex: while you = are mutating the container. Those methods avoid autorelease for = performance, but (as you found) it's also less safe.

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is nobody's problem but Habeas's. A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt. I have yet to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10). If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1, there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their thresholds to 5.

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam, and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g., SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue. There's nobody left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark. Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed. Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops, then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that everybody has to pay them for. The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the privilege of policing their trademark for them. I don't believe they'll ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.

This is something that often annoys me. Programmers can spend hours inlining code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance. The best performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm. Most function calls get made very rarely. Optimising them often makes no sense, produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms. Inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small - such as string manipulation routines. But these are a small part of most applications. One example I frequently see is people optimising a database function call. Most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of instruction cycles. Trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost saving of, say, 5 seconds in 20 hours. But a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline optimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes. - Matthew (who really should be writing code) __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

ham,"Microsoft buys XDegress - more of a p2p/distributed data thing...I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client... http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html ""Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run on the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts. Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is loaded, as JavaScript functions do. And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their browser."" === ""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default ""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house applications."" ""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several cached locations simultaneously.

I assumed he had done that (it's what I asked him to do), in which case the reported behaviour indicates something odd going on. Of course, the xev output he posted came from the mouse leaving the xev window, so maybe you're right and he misunderstood the instructions. So, to make it even clearer: Move the xev window if necessary so it doesn't cover the terminal window. Middle click in it, preferably without moving the mouse, even a little. You should now see the mouse click event in the terminal window. The moment you move the mouse, tons of movement events will roll in and scroll the click events right out of the terminal window. - Harald _______________________________________________ Do not post admin requests to the list.

Yes ;) first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released version. That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your own. second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means ""so much has been changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release anyway"". So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.

All of those who perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and, indeed, for all of us. But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers must be replaced on the site. About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost, along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity. Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15% of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding. If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them, and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""This is New York, a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" That is why they were destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement. In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or simply never rebuilt. These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was. Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size. That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct ""Train-to-the-Plane"" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development. And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only heightens the need. As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed, at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet. We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s' rate. Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor will most New Yorkers. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times that the city ""has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the future."" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate -- and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area. The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task. Mr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm whose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site. -- ----------------- R. A.

Now entering its fourth week as front-page news, WorldCom woes continue to sap investor confidence. This week's big story: the top execs from the company are standing silent against government accusations of wrongdoing. 2 BearShare 4.0 : This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer software was been completely redesigned and comes in two flavors: free with ads and paid without ads. This is nice touch, but unfortunately, 4.0 fails in one key area: downloading music. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's tests, it had an abysmal success rate at actually returning files. 3 Jaguar : Who ever heard of an operating system release being early? Well, Apple is managing to pull off the impossible; it intends to ship an update to OS X in August, instead of the anticipated late fall time frame. 4 Warcraft III : Ah, summer: the perfect time to stay inside and sit in front of your computer.

ham,"[IIU] spyware calling home?Hello all I'm looking for advice. My pc has developed a disturbing tendency of trying to access IP 62.17.143.253 without my consent. It has got to the stage where normal web-browsing is almost impossible. I have checked IP address on RIPE database and I know precisely who is being called. I contacted that company on 14 July, when the problem first arose and asked for a remedy but (surprise) got no reply. A helpful person on the ie.comp list suggested Adaware spyware removal. I ran this and haven't had a problem again until today. The offending program is obviously not in Adaware db. (I run adaware with current ref files every day now). Any suggestions, please, for removing whatever the f*** is causing this from my pc?

ham,"Re: ICMCompressionSession question>> I have no idea what that's supposed to mean. You'd use a = decompression session and do whatever you want with the pixel buffers it = gives you. Why do you think you can't? I believe this is a newbie question related to the general use of the = decompression session. Let me try to explain:=20 First I initialize my decompression session within the data proc = callback function: *******START*********** if (videoData->decompressionSession =3D=3D NULL) { cout width, = videoData->height,k32BGRAPixelFormat,=20 displayAndCompressFrame, videoData,=20 &videoData->decompressionSession); if (err =3D=3D 0) cout compressionSession =3D=3D NULL) { cout width, videoData->height, = videoData->codecType,=20 videoData->averageDataRate, = videoData->timeScale, useCompressedFrame, videoData, &videoData->compressionSession ); if (err =3D=3D 0) cout decompressionSession, (UInt8 *)p, len, NULL, &frameTime, videoData ); *******END*********** which finally allows me to access the pure pixelBuffer to be accessed in = my ""displayAndCompressFrame"" function. In my ""displayAndCompressFrame""-function I display the pixels on a = custom frame and compress the frame via: *******START*********** err =3D ICMCompressionSessionEncodeFrame( videoData->compressionSession, = pixelBuffer, displayTime, displayDuration, = validTimeFlags, frameOptions, NULL, NULL ); *******END*********** This triggers my ""useCompressedFrame""-function: *******START*********** static OSStatus useCompressedFrame( void *encodedFrameOutputRefCon, ICMCompressionSessionRef session, OSStatus err, ICMEncodedFrameRef encodedFrame, void *reserved ){ int size =3D ICMEncodedFrameGetDataSize( encodedFrame ); //// WHAT NOW ??? return err; } ******** END*************** in which I can send the encoded frame across a network but before I = involve any network functionality I first want to test if the = decompression works. However, here is the problem and I will start with = a simple first question:=20 Can I feed the encoded frame to the same decompression session which = decompresses my device data and displays it or do I need to create a = second decompression session with the respective callback ? If I need to = create another decompression session are there any special requirements = I need to take care of - so far my first try also failed.

According to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head, shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners. The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit people's shape. The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee. It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches) taller than his French counterpart. The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4. The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and 1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and Americans 1,626.7mm More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men and 66.7 for women. The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7 inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and 806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of 1,047.2mm. The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place. The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm. However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm, compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.

So, I went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applets (yes, I did change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH back) and the panel can't make new workspaces. Any ideas what could have happened ?

The technique works for input values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents. "

This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established - there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants, but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created much more easily within the petrochemical industry. Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants. My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason. Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals (that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen, just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on, for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers. All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

Interestingly, if I grab the applet window, I get the clipped applet display stretched to fit the size of the entire applet window. If I grab the firefox window, I just get the firefox window display. I guess this makes sense since the applet runs in a separate process, though I don't understand why the applet display is getting messed up.

I installed 10M3050 and it looks like overall a big improvement. In particlar, the rendering errors I've seen are gone. However, I have noticed one new problem which I don't think was present in the previous version of the plugin. I can't (mouse) drag inside an applet in Firefox. Dragging works in Safari.

I *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01 clues. But that's wrong too! It looks I haven't grokked this part of your code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues, and no others made it into the list. I thought it was looking for clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren't exactly 0.5? > That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues! This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few similar ones. I wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the HTML.

You ought to 'cvs update' and see if your issue becomes any clearer with all the brush removed. My patch notes that 'msgid' and 'line' are redundant with one another and removes one or the other from functions which takes both. The callers are then changed to pass what the function expects. In the case of Msg_Change, the 'line' argument is removed and we only have the msgid argument. Ftoc_ClearCurrent is now the first line of MsgChange.

I see... I now think placing pointer to FAQ should be good idea to explain all these issues. I need to think think about the context of these. This was in section describing ""archive"". (I have other place where I say ""For your **production server**, the `stable` suite with the security updates is recommended."") So I am updating as: TIP: If ""`sid`"" is used in the above example instead of ""`@-@codename-stable@-@`"", the ""`deb: http://security.debian.org/ ...`"" line for security updates in the ""`/etc/apt/sources.list`"" is not required. This is because there is no security update archive for ""`sid`"" (`unstable`). NOTE: The security bugs for the `stable` archive are fixed by the Debian security team. This activity has been quite rigorous and reliable. Those for the `testing` archive may be fixed by the Debian testing security team. For several reasons, this activity is not as rigorous as that for `stable` and you may need to wait for the migration of fixed `unstable` packages. Those for the `unstable` archive are fixed by the individual maintainer. Actively maintained `unstable` packages are usually in a fairly good shape by leveraging latest upstream security fixes.

As far as the safety of your data is concerned, none of your emails are stored in MySQL (yet). Mail storage is still in the file system, Akonadi is only used for contacts. That said, I'd be much happier myself without having to run yet another database server on my machine. Right now there are ""global"" instances of PostgreSQL and MySQL (personal and for work); on top of that, for each logged-in user, Akonadi runs a private MySQL server as well as a virtuoso server. Incidentally, virtuoso is a SQL database in its own right, persumably fully capable of completing supplanting MySQL in this case.

ham,"Lindows.com: Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the MythsFrom nobody Mon Mar 5 10:42:14 2018 Content-Type: text/plain; 	charset=""us-ascii"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit If this message is not displaying properly, click here to launch it in your browser. Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths A reporter came by the Lindows.com offices last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use LindowsOS to write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch. I turned on the Walmart.com computer and then clicked on the running man which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse where I installed OpenOffice using Click-N-Run. I then clicked the ""Run It"" button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer. I then typed ""Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save hundreds using LindowsOS."" I selected ""Save as Microsoft Word."" The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters, he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to overcome a couple of myths. The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5 minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at . The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist. Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these products is via the Click-N-Run Warehouse. Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in the Warehouse all downloaded and installed with a single click: OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and swap them with Microsoft counterparts. Programs included are: OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs) OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel) OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint) OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program Click here for a great tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice. GIMP If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop, you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor. Evolution For those used to Microsoft's Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home. Check out how easy it is to use . Flowchart Pro, which is similar to Microsoft's Visio, is a rich charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and organizational charts, plus more. See how easy it for yourself, visit Flowchart Pro at This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the Warehouse that make Linux a practical choice for the desktop today. And if you're still not convinced, then do the math. For a total cost of $499 , including all software, computer users save more than $800 for a complete system. With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped systems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars stretched much further running LindowsOS. Michael Robertson Please visit to answers questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer! LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com Builder partners. The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware. The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs.

ham,"[ILUG] semaphores on linux RH7.3Hi All, I have a question which is a bit tricky and was wondering of anyone has come across this problem before or could point me in the right direction. I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to Linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way semaphores are being handled. The application uses mulitple processes to run application code with the main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled via semaphores. In certain circumstances the main process and the application child process seem to lock up both waiting for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that the semaphore code is doing the correct things for syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the semop() system call. I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay between changing semaphore states the problem goes away, but this causes our entire application to run really sloooww !! lol Is there anything weird or different with the standard implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state in a semaphore immediately? Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno == EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails (-1) also fixes the problem but again system performance goes down the toilet. both the parent controlling process run as the same uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with permissions 0666. Any pointers would be appreciated! Rgds, Colin Nevin __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Robert Harley: >It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, >precisely identical between males and females. Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations. But that obscures the different modes of promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense of the word. But their motives and behavior are quite different. Langur monkeys were the example in the cited article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But cozying up to the current dominant male isn't the best strategy for female langurs, because ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide,"" by the male who is likely next to rule the roost. Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a better picture of that. ;-) _________________________________________________________________ Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com "

Offering more Intel-server based consolidation opportunities than ever, GSX Server 2.0 includes support for AMD's Athlon XP and Intel's Xeon processors. Read the full story Server consolidation eases system management 	 Software contracts: Clause for alarm In the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's the language in the contracts . Enterprise customers spend surprisingly little time pouring over the fine print of multi-million dollar software contracts that are rife with obscure terminology, vague expansion charges, and mind-boggling license conversions . As a result, they end up paying in ways they had never imagined long after the deal is signed. Just ask California. Read the fine print Six steps to the best TCO with Linux Don't just bring in Linux as yet another OS to manage. To help you determine whether Linux offers better TCO than Windows, Gartner examines the benefits and pitfalls of deploying Linux-based servers.

The specs are impressive: Dual 1GHz PowerPC G4s, up to 2GB DDR SDRAM, two 64-bit 66MHz PCI slots (plus a third combination PCI/AGP slot), dual Gigabit Ethernet, FireWire and USB ports, and four Ultra ATA/100 Apple Drive Module bays.

ham,"Pluck and LuckAnyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at part of the equation. America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy. But -- and this is a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list. There is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the right time, to go that high. Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is involved in significant wealth. Being a super-model, for example. Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models. Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school. Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms. It is the rest of us who tend to sort. There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the first place. Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist. Sowell seems to agree at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous. And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring? IQ? Purity of heart? Or the ability to satisfy customers? Functionally most people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart. Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition. Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far more animosity than differences due to luck. Luck can be forgiven.

ham,"Living Love - Another legacy of the 60'sNormally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated with fairly good ideas. Just a big turnoff. A good example would be the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc. (This was one of the many topics I obsessively absorbed as a teenager.) Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / G-Force Dyno-Staff. I have to say however that, having found this while looking for something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms. I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction. Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc. To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize. Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models. I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and justify US/UN foreign policy and actions. http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/ (Apologies for the embedded HTML.) We create the world we live in. A loving person lives in a loving world, A hostile person lives in a hostile world. Everyone you meet is your mirror. You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have. The past is dead, The future is imaginary, Happiness can only be in the Eternal Now Moment How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have. Love a person because he or she is there. This is the only reason. Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences. The purpose of our lives is to be free of all addictive traps, and thus become one with the ocean of Living Love. sdw -- sdw@lig.net http://sdw.st Stephen D.

ham,"RE: CO2 and climate (was RE: Goodbye Global Warming)OK, let's bring some data into the discussion: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm (A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperature fluctuations over the past 400k years). > Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and > temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest > correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases > are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the > increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature > preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done > of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are > correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly > causative. Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to be causal. > With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to > point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly > regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years. Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2. > As it > happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous > cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. Not correct. Mauna Loa data and show that the current CO2 concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine resolution). > In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm (Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the ""historical record""). Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing. There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point. > but it looks a lot like we > would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical > record. At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2 > concentrations. Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly spike, and then return back to ""normal"" background levels (and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores). Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away. > Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately > affects temperature. Again, the interaction is not entirely > predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative > feedback systems mentioned above. Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase, but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be enormous. > Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it > makes up for it in volume in some cases. Gases such as water and > methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule > basis. Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something > that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the > biosphere. Correct. Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in methane levels as well. Data on water vapor here: http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html > CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent > studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a > passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver. I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar, wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense (burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a ""sustainable"" level are unrealistic -- Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and improved efficiency is an easy sell. - Jim "

ham,"Debian-style task-packages for RH8.0 availableHi, This has been hashed over a few times on various lists, now I finally got around to doing something about it... You can now add ""rpm http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/ redhat/8.0 task"" to your sources.list and after apt-get update you can find out what's available with 'apt-cache search ^task-' These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by running http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py. BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an apt-enabled mirror of RH8.0 in your sources.list to actually do anything with it. -- 	- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list "

I am looking > forward to any advice, particularly of the been-there-done-that type: > * how should I configure my fstab entry? How does Debian installer do > it? Watch out for permissions -- /tmp is ""1777"" (rwxrwxrwt), it has to be world-writable and have the sticky bit set, which ensures that only users who create files in there can write to them. Permissions come from the mounted FS, not the mount point, so make sure you set these permissions while it's mounted. Because of the world-writability, security conscious admins mount it nodev and nosuid. If you're more careful, you can mount it noexec, too, but that will break some third-party software installers that work by examining your system, writing a custom config script inside /tmp somewhere, and then running it. So your fstab entry might look like: > /dev/with/temp/ /tmp ext3 nosuid,nodev 0 2 > * is there anything Debian-specific to watch for? Not that I recall. > * is it true that setting /tmp permissions to non-executable, while > hardening your box, prevents apt from working properly? Setting /tmp to non-executable by the noexec mount option does break things, but as I said above, my recollection is that it mostly breaks third-party stuff. I think the apt scripts are all in /var/lib/dkpg/info, and are run from there. Setting the *directory* noexec seems very bad, since the exec bit on directories controls the ability to cd to it, and turning that off would make it largely useless. As to ""why"", on moderately-high-availability multi-user systems, I often put /tmp on a separate partition precisely so I can use mount options to globally control access. This is more important in a truly multi-user system than a home system, of course. Misbehaving apps rarely but sometimes blow the lid off of /tmp, and having it be on its own partition means this doesn't compromise the system as a whole, and you can easily figure out what's going on by seeing the logged errors and looking at ""df"" output. Some folks keep /var/log on a separate partition for similar reasons. Again, all of this is more important in a multi-user production environment. On my home systems, I mostly don't worry about this sort of thing. 					-- A. -- Andrew Reid / reidac@bellatlantic.net -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

It's a correct error too. Using the install dialog I tried to make folder ~/Desktop/crap2, but maybe messed up (that dialog is horrid) because it's actually created a folder ~/crap2. Which is empty, and note this isn't ~/crap2/Desktop as in the error message above. So it's looking in the wrong place. By the way that install dialog is REALLY horrible. :) Especially that you're just thrown into it. I hope you can remove the install process. You could make it into a .dmg-distributed .app-bundle for Mac users instead of WebStart at all, which would be nice. WebStart can be ok too, but please make it really be WebStart, ie let Java manage where the program files are stored. Either way, there's no need to make users select a folder for user data either - you can automatically store any user data files somewhere reasonable like ~/Library/Application Support/yourapp on Mac, the equivalent Application Data folder on Windows, and ~/.AppName on other platforms. Either 'normal WebStart' or '.app bundle in DMG' would give you an app that requires no configuration or installation process, making it much easier/less scary for users to install and try out your app. Would probably also sidestep this platform bug (?). :) --sam PS If it wasn't clear, I haven't installed the developer preview yet, so still on 1.6.0_17... really need to do that soon. _______________________________________________ Do not post admin requests to the list.

ham,"Colonial Script ...Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes. But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies. And, BTW, England as well. Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons. First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper. Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement. (In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.) OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling. Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU. =========================== The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money. The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid. So almost all the literature talks about that. But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board. I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect.

The evidence for it is extremely meagre. New Worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people, which is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive in. Their records show that they were plagued with them long before 1492. Take Ireland in the early 1800s. Assume a population of circa 8 million. Take Ireland around 1900. Assume a population not much above 3 million. Ignore natural variations between mortality and natality. Omit emigration. Observe the Great Famine in the middle. Deduce that it killed 5 million (actually about 1). Transpose to 16th century Mexico. Grossly inflate estimates of pre-contact population, because nobody has a damn clue what it was anyway. Underestimate later population levels. Deduce that 10's of millions died. Lather, rinse, repeat. R http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork "

The technique works for input values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents. "
ham,"Why is it so hard to get a cab in San Francisco?URL: http://boingboing.net/#85519806 Date: Not supplied A San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my (non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor drivers can't unionize.

If you want it another way, lets change the Constitution. Huh? Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard? Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos. The tactic is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos. And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-).

Whether out of heartfelt patriotism in the wake of Sept. 11 or the desire to tap into the nearly $38 billion budgeted for homeland security spending in 2003, many information technology companies that previously paid little attention to government contracts are now going to great lengths to attract government business. July 12, 2002, 11:20 AM PT | Read Full Story Lukewarm response to Juniper moves Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass. Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive. July 12, 2002, 12:00 PM PT | Read Full Story USA Today investigating hack attack National newspaper USA Today said Friday that one or more online vandals had posted a fake front page and six phony news stories on its Web site. Network administrators have yet to determine how the vandals compromised the company's Web server Thursday night.

If > neither USB nor firewire do smart, you choices are very limited. Well, the sad story is that I don't really want to do S.M.A.R.T. I was experiencing disk errors on the drives which caused something in the kernel to throw a fit. When this happened, the only recovery I could find was to reboot. This is slow and not really a way to learn how to fix the problem. So I ask for advice on this list. I work down the list of suggestions, not having much success, and arrive at smartctl. But now we know that that doesn't work for reasons that I might have known if I had read the whole of wikipedia and had total recall --- but I hadn't and I don't. Since my last post, I have succeeded in doing a successful, error free, backup to each of the disks. One notable fact about all the errors is that after reboot it would appear that no data was lost and the backup could be resumed from where it advanced to just before the crash. The only thing that I can think that I did differently in these new successful runs is that I did not sit at the computer and watch. Can software detect being watched? I think not, but ... My reading about eSATA gives me suspicion that it has its own poorly documented problems. I'm not convinced that I cannot make USB work without S.M.A.R.T, but I really don't have any good ideas as to how. And now, without errors happening fairly frequently, I doubt that I will be able to test and debug any approach that I dream up. > > The only other realistic option I know of is eSATA, but a quick scan of > Newegg shows only 6 devices total, 2 DVR expander drives and 4 eSATA RAID > enclosures.

To > multiple computers or just one computer? This is for a LAN of desktop systems, three computers in all. One computer acts as a collector of backups from the itself and the other two, and is responsible for getting the files onto an external drive in a timely way. All of the computers are hand-me-downs. None have eSATA capability. So far I have not convinced myself that spending money would help solve the problem. Perhaps in a few years, computers with eSATA will start showing up in dumpsters. Maybe I should just wait. -- Paul E Condon pecondon@mesanetworks.net -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"". Trouble?

Continuous End-User testing, constructive feedback, and suggestions on how to improve the system. Upgrade each time a new beta version comes out, so everyone is testing on the same version of the code, and old bugs don't get reported as being in the new version, thus slowing down the debugging process. Report any installation issues, bugs, errors, etc., to the V2 beta list (http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-testers) so that they can be quickly looked at, etc. Provide detailed description of issues, include logs if possible, as well as any ""captured"" spam that generated the error(s).

Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar. Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza. They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down. One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot. The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane. ""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout."" Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot. There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell. This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong. Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released. Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department. The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too closely."" If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail. Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed."" Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention. ""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security."" -- ----------------- R. A.

Sounds like what you need is something to kick up once and score an entire mailbox. Wait a second... So *that's* why you wanted -u. If you can spare the memory, you might get better performance in this case using the pickle store, since it only has to go to disk once (but boy, does it ever go to disk!) I can't think of anything obvious to speed things up once it's all loaded into memory, though.

ham,"strange issue after upgrading to latest 10.6.3Hi folks, I *think* this happened after upgrading to 10.6.3, but I also recall there was a security patch, I apologize because I was sort of absentmindedly updating myself which I hadn't done in a while. So...er, not exactly sure what the cause is. But, the issue is this: When I'm using X11/XQuartz (I've just tried the default xterm as well as rxvt I installed via macports), what seems to happen is that I can open a terminal and use it for a little while, but if I leave x11, that is if it looses focus, and then I come back, I can no longer switch between windows, enter anything with the keyboard, click and select windows with my mouse, etc. All input to x11 seems to be dead. I have to kill it and then restart it again to get it to work at all, and then the same thing happens. I've tried reinstalling it but that hasn't helped. Does this behavior ring a bell to anyone?

The pieces of interest are the papers by Prof. Robert Clark, who perhaps might not be a bad choice of speaker for some future LUG gathering. One of the more eye-opening comments in the second of his papers is that Irish legislation is, in effect, more draconian than the DMCA. http://www.cai.ie/Past%20Events.html#2002 There are some other interesting pieces here, too, for anyone concerned about copyright and the like in Ireland.

ham,"recompiling the kernel with a different version nameHi I've just recompiled the kernel from sources with the command fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-recompiled kernel-image kernel-headers and installed it successfully. However, the kernel name is 2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompiled and that ""+drm33.1"" seems to cause problems to Eclipse which does not recognize it as a valid version (I think the problem is with the '+' character). Is there a way to change the version so that I can do without that '+'? thanks in advance 	Lorenzo -- Lorenzo Bettini, PhD in Computer Science, DI, Univ.

This is a pain. The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do: rpm -Uvh libvorbis-* RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time, and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already installed is beyond me.

IMHO. BS> Bill No offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him. My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth. (Which is the gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar) The screaming isn't the most effective method around. I don't believe I argued that it was. But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the people doing the screaming are concerned. For the record, I don't support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier). I don't think that this is what the 1st Amendment was implying. These folks -do- have a right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the folks they elected in the first place. My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases such as Mr. Nell. He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion. He has a right to possess this opinion and make it known to the representatives that are elected. A sign is not a shout-out. I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming dissenters to the mix. I was mostly responding with my miffedness in having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the policy reasons that might have contributed to it. IN this case, the screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from the folks they need to speak with. They're resorting to creative, offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum. The 'My generation never did this ' is all BS. THere's more to this story, we just dont' know it all. I hope this clarifies my position. For the quick rehash: Screaming != Free speech on all cases. Dissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by the Supremes. K? -- Best regards, bitbitch mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net "

It looks OK to me; your custom rules file is read by udev (line 24) and the corresponding variables are set (lines 110-116). > I do know that /etc/udev/rules.d/66-xorg-synaptics.rules is the file > that I created when HAL stopped working, and it was working up until > two days ago (more or less). I now tried to activate the extra options in the fdi file that comes with xserver-xorg-input-synaptics and that gave me right-edge-scrolling and the other stuff. Thus it seems that the fdi directives are working right now on my Sid system. (As I wrote earlier, I have not used these features in a long while, therefore I do not know if the fdi files worked all the time or if this functionality was only recently restored.) I suggest that you try the same approach and then we can compare our results. In other words: 1) Shut down X and remove your custom udev rules for the time being, then restart udev. (invoke-rc.d udev restart) 2) Uncomment the extra rules in /usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/20thirdparty/11-x11-synaptics.fdi. You have to close the comment in the "" "" to the end of this line; also insert a new line with ""<!--"" just before the line starting with ""For other possible options, check"". 3) Restart dbus, which will also restart hal. (invoke-rc.d debus restart) 4) Verify that hal is paying attention to the newly-uncommented options; the output of =20 lshal -u $(hal-find-by-capability --capability input.touchpad) should include: input.x11_driver =3D 'synaptics' (string) input.x11_options.CircularScrolling =3D 'true' (string) input.x11_options.HorizTwoFingerScroll =3D 'true' (string) input.x11_options.MaxTapMove =3D '2000' (string) input.x11_options.SHMConfig =3D 'true' (string) input.x11_options.VertEdgeScroll =3D 'true' (string) input.x11_options.VertTwoFingerScroll =3D 'true' (string) 5) Restart X, then find the synaptics part in /var/log/Xorg.0.log. It should contain lines like these: (II) config/hal: Adding input device SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad (II) LoadModule: ""synaptics"" (II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input//synaptics_drv.so (II) Module synaptics: vendor=3D""X.Org Foundation"" compiled for 1.6.5, module version =3D 1.2.0 Module class: X.Org XInput Driver ABI class: X.Org XInput driver, version 4.0 (II) Synaptics touchpad driver version 1.2.0 (**) Option ""Device"" ""/dev/input/event7"" (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: x-axis range 1472 - 5472 (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: y-axis range 1408 - 4448 (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: pressure range 0 - 255 (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: finger width range 0 - 0 (II) SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad: buttons: left right middle double triple (**) Option ""SHMConfig"" ""true"" (**) Option ""MaxTapMove"" ""2000"" (**) Option ""VertEdgeScroll"" ""true"" (**) Option ""VertTwoFingerScroll"" ""true"" (**) Option ""HorizTwoFingerScroll"" ""true"" (**) Option ""CircularScrolling"" ""true"" 6) Check if VertEdgeScroll and the other stuff works; if it does then you can try to add your other options to the fdi file and remove the ones that you do not like. Once you are done with the tests you can restore 20thirdparty/11-x11-synaptics.fdi to its original state and put your rules into a separate fdi files so that they will not be overwritten at the next upgrade of xserver-xorg-input-synaptics. --=20 Regards, | Florian | -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

I've done a dist-upgrade from 7.2 to a quite broken rawhide release... it was a mess, still, it went much faster and smoother than if I had done it ""manually"" with rpm -U or -F.

ham,"More acroread printing problemsHello, all. With the appreciate help from this list, we finally learned we needed to install Acrobat Reader version 9.3.2 from unstable into our Lenny systems in order for Acrobat to see our CUPS printers. However we are still having problems printing anything other than letter size jobs. It looks like acroread is creating an lpr command using the -o PageRegion and setting that option incorrectly. For example, in one case we saw -o PageSize=11x17 -p PageRegion=Letter which printed the 11x17 print job on letter sized paper. On a plotter we saw -o PageSize=24x36 -p PageRegion=A4 which resulted in the plotter rejecting the job as an invalid page size. Bypassing the Acroread print command by using a Custom printer and sending the job to KPrinter works so this seems to be a clear bug in how Acrobat is reading the PPD file and creating the print command. Has anyone else encountered this problem? Is there a workaround? If not, I suppose I'll need to figure out how one reports bugs for acroread to Adobe.

ham,"Re: New Sequences WindowWell, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective. However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read? Perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view? Just idle speculation - we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are. Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log. We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 - Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks"" (high resolution timer) for some time. But in 8.3 we've calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds. It is still only useful for relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record. Of course, we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record, etc. I'll try it out. >>>Chris Garrigues said: > > From: Brent Welch > > Date: Wed, 28 Aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700 > > > > > > >>>Robert Elz said: > > > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the > > > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called. > > > > In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify > time, > > but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to > > check their date stamp, you could just read them again. > > Do you really think this is true?

I don't have access to the other system currently, but I'll certainly check whether changing this works, when I get a chance.

ham,"Re: [ILUG] SUSE 8 disks? (thread changed slightly)Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com): > I'm confused. I thought it was GPL'ed and that the money you paid SuSE > was for your 60 day support or whatever? Yes, you're confused. A Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots of separate codebases. Some are under the GNU GPL. Many are not. Are you clear on this point, now? This is my second try. One suspects that you actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it. You're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to get covered software for free. It does not. It provides that _if_ you've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have rights to also receive the matching source code. > I don't particularly need support, so I'm not really interested in > purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use. Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way you can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not ""lend"" or duplicate) you his copy. > Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so > I'll just ask him. Ask him _what_? If you're asking him to ""lend"" or duplicate his CDs, then you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally. Don't like SuSE's product licensing? Write your own distribution. You can even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_. All you have to do is heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces. What, you think that's too much work? Then, try a different distribution. Clue: _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set. Even RH 7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among others. (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other hand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether open source or not.) -- Hi! I'm a .signature virus!

ham,"SMTP-Error 451 while using smarthost for mail deliveryHello alltogether Currently I am trying to set up a Debian Lenny Server, but I am stuck at mail delivery. The server I am trying to set up, has no FQDN, so I used my ISP-Mailserver as a smarthost (I enabled the proper SMTP authentication in exim4). This setup worked a few days, before I suddenly received 451 errors. At first I thought it to be a problem with Exim4, so I switched to postfix. But postfix also gives me the 451 error: Apr 22 15:53:31 openshoolproxy postfix/smtp[24368]: 413CF26EF9: to= , orig_to= , relay=smtp.strato.com[81.169.145.132]:25, delay=2137, delays=2136/0.05/0.33/0.12, dsn=4.0.0, status=deferred (host smtp.strato.com[81.169.145.132] said: 451 Local Error (in reply to end of DATA command)) To further troubleshoot my problem I used telnet to connect to smtp.strato.com and to send a mail manually.

Yet, udev now also > stopped working... OK, I think I understand a little bit better how this is supposed to be working now. Try to add your touchpad options to the InputClass section of the file /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf as a first test. There seems to be a new mechanism that allows for multiple such InputClass sections matching the same device, so that its configuration can be spread over several files, with each file being able to add options and to override settings made in previous files. If this works as advertised then it should be possible to add your customizations in a separate InputClass section in, say, 99-local.conf and thus make sure that they are not overwritten when the synaptics driver is upgraded. That seems to have all the modularity advantages of the earlier hal/udev methods with the added bonus of the simpler xorg.conf syntax. I am curious to hear if this actually works because I cannot try it myself.

American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now. The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. ""In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time,"" said the Journal. ""Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price, not time."" In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United. Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. ""The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,"" said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor frustration. The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. ""The U.S. government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and federal loan guarantees"" while ""European authorities have acted more wisely,"" letting Swissair and Sabena ""go to the wall,"" said the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and Canada 3000.

These are companies that once referred to Linux as a ""bathtub of code"" (Sun) and ""a cancer"" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown paper the San Jose Mercury News. Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year. Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: ""Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon."" Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- ""a place where you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,"" deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: ""Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow."" Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called ""Solinux."" How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux. The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. ""Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux,"" Poletti reported.

No specific suggestions. A caution: go to a store and make sure your future netbook supports ACPI. I've had bad experiences with my cheap Toshiba Satellite L305 series laptop: the fan controls (and most other ACPI registers) do nothing. It seems either Toshiba or the BIOS maker Insyde H2O has chosen non-standard SSDT/DSDT table values, with the result that only Microsoft's OS knows where to twiddle. There are reports that the omnibook module will correctly handle Insyde H2O BIOS'ed notebook. Have yet to test here.

I run 10.5 on such a powerbook as well as a 1GHz G4 eMac. If anything performance overall was improved over 10.4. One have 1GB of RAM the other 3/4 GB. The only downside was that at some point there was an update to 10.5 where my firewire enclosure became unreliable. It seems to affect certain ide to fw bridge chips in hard drive enclosures and I was unlucky. I can usually power cycle the drive and try again successfully. It matters not which cable and drive I use, I have three enclosures, and once is the culprit. With regards to X11, the growing pains are mostly over for me. I do use Xvnc for 8-bit though. This may be improved in later versions of X11 though. The key options to Xvnc are -cc 3 -depth 8 mzs _______________________________________________ Do not post admin requests to the list.

ham,"How do I fsck and XFS file system in ""Squeeze"" OK, I'm stumped. I was having some problems which were likely related to the old kernel in Debian ""Lenny"", so I upgraded to ""Squeeze"" in order to alleviate the issue, which it apparently has. Now, however, I need to fsck the main array on the box, which is formatted as XFS. The xfs-repair utility is not on the upgraded system. (I was forced to do a fresh install of the boot drive.) How can I obtain the XFS file utilities - particularly xfs-repair - under ""Squeeze""? -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"". Trouble?

First of all, forgive me for cross-posting, which is generally a no-no. But if you can cross-post, I can cross-reply. Second, unless you reply to debian-user, to which I am subscribed, please CC me. I am not subscribed to any of the other lists. I am not a Debian package maintainer or a Debian developer. I am just an ordinary system administrator. So I'm sure that my opinion will not count for much. But I am opposed to the removal of lilo. Both grub-legacy and grub-pc use sectors on the hard disk outside of the master boot record (cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1). In other words they use cylinder 0, head 0, sector 2 and possibly subsequent sectors on cylinder 0 head 0. This breaks the design of the backup software that my employer uses. This backup software backs up the master boot record and all partitions; but since the extra sectors used by grub-legacy and grub-pc are outside the master boot record and are not part of any partition, they don't get backed up. Consequently, if we have a hard drive failure and restore from a backup, we have an unbootable machine. Lilo uses only the master boot record. A lilo-booted machine can be backed up and restored with our existing backup software just fine. Given these requirements, I wouldn't use grub-pc even if it were bug free and well documented. (But neither is the case!) As for the claims that kernels are too big now, I find that hard to believe, especially now that we have the large-memory option available. The standard stock Debian kernel image file that I use for Squeeze, vmlinuz-2.6.32-3-686, is currently 2234080 bytes. Are you trying to tell me that there's no room for a 2M kernel below the start of the EBDA? I am able to load *both* the kernel *and* the initial RAM filesystem below the EBDA (i.e. the large-memory option is not used) if I use MODULES=dep instead of MODULES=most in the initial RAM filesystem under Lenny. I'll bet I can do it with Squeeze too. I realize that lilo doesn't work for everyone, and I'm not suggesting that it be the default bootloader; but to get rid of it entirely is unacceptable. As far as I know, it's the only bootloader that meets all of my requirements, and I will not voluntarily give it up. No doubt you will tell me that I am welcome to maintain it myself. Unfortunately, I do not have the requisite skills to do so. All I can do is to appeal in the name of reason that it not be dropped. Also, please excuse my ignorance, but what exactly is this ""payload size"" to which you refer? Is that the same thing as the size of the kernel? Or is it something else? -- .''`.

Death is something we all must deal with, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone actually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she had seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't interacted much over the past few years, she was still able to see me on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to Jon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a few months ago: ""I evangelized for months last year for having our company at the first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines last October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite being postponed by 9/11, and having to move the venue at the last minute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again being 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this year. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email publishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a friend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their Call for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you get the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I have my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis. It's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole."" I returned from speaking to another user group the other night and found that approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered. Sweet! When I started looking closer at the numbers, I realized that Jake was offering his Converting Vinyl LPs to CD eBook for free - and that's all anybody was taking. No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them were just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a problem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out the non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please look again ). A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In fact, Jake's also written one for OS X (which probably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple machine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use Dreamweaver . Which reminds me: Jake's also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly newsletter. So, if you haven't read that in a while, I'd encourage you to give it another glance. After all, as Elwood Edwards so finely said: You've Got Lockergnome ! Thanks to David Lawrence for making that MP3 a reality. El can make one with your name, too. And yes, that's the AOL guy.

I mean, imagine if while you're surfing, you had to stop and type in a URL every time you wanted to move to a new page. Simply unacceptable. So why not have that convenience when working with other files? This application gives you the option of opening or running any file or program you desire via links. You can also shut down your computer or disable your screensaver through this program. &quot;No installer is required for VLink - it will not change any of your registry settings or other Windows settings; simply extract the files PowerLink.dll and VLink.exe to a directory and run it.&quot; GhiaTracker v1.5 [370k] W9x/2k/XP FREE http://homepage.mac.com/karmannghia/ghiatracker/ {Learn about your Ghia} Gearheads, motorheads, call them whatever you will, but I've never been part of their ranks. Not that I don't like cars, mind you; I find them much more useful than pogo sticks. If you happen to own a little vehicle known as the Karmann Ghia, you should drive on over and download this program. Click on any year between 1956 (the year it went into production) and 1974 to get a brief synopsis of the car and its changes for that year. You can also get other specifications such as torque, horsepower, compression, etc. Even if you're not &quot;into&quot; cars, check this out.

The WebTV Viewer simulates WebTV on your system. Read the online Viewer Installation Guide to find out more on how to use this software. Important: the PC version of the WebTV Viewer (2.6) reflects all of the features of the most recent upgrade from Spring 2001. Note: The Viewer is similar, but not identical, to a real WebTV system. The WebTV Viewer program is currently beta-level software on both Windows and Macintosh. This means that it has not been completely tested and debugged. The WebTV Viewer is like a WebTV browser because: it changes page layout by compressing page width and enlarging text; and it supports HTML, JavaScript, as well as other Internet standards in the same way. The WebTV Viewer is not like a WebTV browser because: your computer monitor has a higher resolution than a television screen, and displays color better; and the Viewer does not support email or audio, while the WebTV browser does.&quot; Recommend It! &nbsp;GnomeWILDCARD Full PDF Books Poor Richard's Web Internet Promotions E-Mail Publishing Web Site Makeover Websites Made Easy Online Communities Home Networking Internet Recruiting Online Branding The Evidence is Against You Scribbled by Jim Girard Every time some new technology has expanded free access to popular music, starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the 1930s, the recording industry has fought it - claiming that it would cost them money. And every time, it has resulted in increased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including Dolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed by the music industry as different from previous such developments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to create their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual result was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music industry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became more popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD technology). The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect - and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of songs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the server-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the phenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused on the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA, and most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've limited their legal challenges to things they know they can win - and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to avoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent). The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright is not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think of as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it, you lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with the window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove away in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be entitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you are voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for the same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a copyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products whenever they're mentioned, and not use words like &quot;Coke&quot; or &quot;Kleenex&quot; as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to do what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a great marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some point could start using the word on their own product, arguing that it is in the public domain. The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually stopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they know from long experience, increases their sales because most of the people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with near-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the cost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the cost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the first place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at establishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright, in the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a legal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain. The thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is the change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a few good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for if they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to make as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it requires charging far more for an individual song that most people are willing to pay. At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of civil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to the Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly directed to realities and necessities, in light of history and case law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most technically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a simple moral or criminal issue. &quot;Common sense&quot; tells a lot of people that copying music without paying for it is just like stealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if common sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have the law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual systems, including not only law but science, are designed in large part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the case in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those systems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that most people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any time a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what he means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you believe that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't be paying him as much as he is. Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It! A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about networking ?

I receive my Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it really useful when you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this isn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article. The trouble here is that the link sometimes returns the message: 'There was an error displaying this link' in the frame. No problem! Right-click, copy shortcut, paste to metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM), then do a global search and replace. The trick is to replace the control codes with the correct characters: %26 is an ampersand; %3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a forward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark. The Windows character map can help with any others. Select a character, look at the status bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the percent sign. In other words, the ampersand (U+0026) is %26 which translastes into a '&amp;' symbol.

But now I'm running (null) beta and I have these questions: which version of ""apt"" can I use, the RH7.3 version or the ""rawhide"" version? Is there a way to use apt to update (null) with the rpms available for (null) through up2date, since I prefer apt to that? If I can use apt, can I use it to get updates from these 3 different places: 1. the (null) up2date Redhat upgrades 2. the (null) files at Freshrpms.net 3. the regular RH7.3 files from freshrpms.net Am I asking for too much simplicity in this complicated world? -- That's ""angle"" as in geometry. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list "

Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail. Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to other unixen like HPUX and SCO. Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract, they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc. If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc, though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore. You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK, who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux, that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

We discovered abandoned the sumof US$37,400,000.00 (Thirty seven million four hundred thousand unitedstates dollars) in an account that belong to one of our foreign customers,an American late Engr. John Creek (Junior) an oil merchant with the federal government of Nigeria who died along with his entire family of a wifeand two children in Kenya Airbus (A310-300) flight KQ430 in November2000. Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin tocome over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannotrelease the fund from his account unless someone applies for claims asthe next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative hasappeared to claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, I and other officialsin my department have agreed to make business with you release the totalamount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came forit or discovered either maintained account with our bank, other wisethe fund will be returned to the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 30%for you as foreign partner and 70% for us the officials in my department. Upon the successful completion of this transfer, my colleague and I willcome to your country and mind our share. It is from our 60% we intendto import computer accessories into my country as way of recycling thefund. To commence this transaction we require you to immediately indicateyour interest by calling me or sending me a fax immediately on the aboveTelefax # and enclose your private contact Telephone #, Fax #, full nameand address and your designated banking co- ordinates to enable us fileletter of claim to the appropriate department for necessary approvalsbefore the transfer can be made.

Here is a list of the regressions in kaffeine I noticed so far: - cannot save tracks from an audio CD as .ogg files anymore - does not display tracks when playing an audio CD, screen is black - stops playing audio CD after first track - window size is fixed, videos are resized to fit window size rather than the other way around - the settings menu is almost empty, nothing to configure anymore apparently - does not have a manual I'm not going to look any further but will rather go back to 0.8.7 and put it on hold. It feels like using an application that is maybe at version 0.2, rather than a 1.0 release candidate. Given that kaffeine 0.8 was a quite mature program with lots of features, I find this very sad.

ham,"[zzzzteana] Big cats 'on the increase'http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers over the past 12 months. And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real. Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the critics and doubters, adding: ""I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same realm as the Loch Ness monster. ""But it's not, they are really out there."" 'Cats with cubs' Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the country. Big cat reports Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales ""This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders, Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,"" he said. The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. ""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 'Trigger camera' The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes, will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. Mr Bamping said: ""The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and take a picture of itself."" 'Like dogs' The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the wild, or their descendants. Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: ""In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. ""But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them down, or take them to a zoo."" ------------------------ Yahoo!

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC in a few minutes yesterday. Sure if it was badly designed it would be 10 times the size and harder to port. If it depended on unavailable libraries it would be much harder. Portable code is easy to port. At least that is the case when then language you used is available on the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java. >5.

(Right now I'm taking time out to write email while waiting for a job to run). Sure I could wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors, or I can do it now when very few people can. >The end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.

ham,"Re: Anolther sequence related tracebackI have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now. (It is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply...) First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback. This one solves the initial problem: --- mh.tcl.WAS	Thu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002 +++ mh.tcl	Wed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002 @@ -487,6 +487,10 @@ set seq {} set rseq {} foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] { +	if ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] { +	 # just ignore anything bogus +	 continue; +	} 	set parts [split [string trim $range] -] 	if {[llength $parts] == 1} { 	 lappend seq $parts That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue"" if you like, but I don't think an error is needed). But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place, by typing ""NNN-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this, I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion. But rather than have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck a ""catch"" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed. This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it. But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before. If you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that is typed). I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now I found it, I think its nice. But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well? That kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it. And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from the keyboard. So I fixed that as well. This makes two different restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway, so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name being typed is empty. I'm less happy about that part, but I think I can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to exist and be typed. Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me. In ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is the key used to show a message. But if you've just typed 123, and the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead. So I ""fixed"" this one as well. ""Fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something else, it will remain 's' in here. I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here. \r continues to work of course. And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G). Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings. In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that. I believe that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the ""catch"" around the ""MsgShow"" will hide the problem (I don't think we really need to fix Brent's way of invoking it). Or include it anyway, just for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then). kre --- select.tcl.WAS	Thu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002 +++ select.tcl	Wed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002 @@ -49,9 +49,11 @@ bindtags $w [list $w Entry] bind $w 	{SelectTypein %W %A} bind $w 	{SelectToggle %W } + bind $w 	{SelectPrev %W } bind $w 	{SelectComplete %W} bind $w 	{SelectComplete %W} bind $w 	{SelectReturn %W} + bind $w 	{SelectReturn %W %A} bind $w 	{SelectBackSpace %W} bind $w 	{SelectBackSpace %W} bind $w 	{SelectBackSpace %W} @@ -72,7 +74,7 @@ append select(sel) $a Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" if ![info exists select(folder)] { -	Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow +	catch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow } } } proc SelectBackSpace { w } { @@ -91,6 +93,10 @@ proc SelectToggle {w} { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { +	if {$select(sel) != """"} { +	 SelectTypein $w + +	 return +	} 	set select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]] 	set select(prompt) ""[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:"" } else { @@ -101,6 +107,18 @@ } Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" } +proc SelectPrev {w} { + global select + if [info exists select(folder)] { +	SelectTypein $w ""-"" + } else { +	catch { +	 incr select(sel) -1 +	 Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow +	} + Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" + } +} proc SelectComplete { w } { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { @@ -126,9 +144,13 @@ 	Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" } } -proc SelectReturn { w } { +proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { +	if {$a != {}} { +	 SelectTypein $w $a +	 return +	} 	if [info exists select(match)] { 	 set select(sel) $select(match) 	 unset select(match) @@ -151,6 +173,7 @@ 	unset select(folder) } $select(entry) configure -state disabled + Exmh_Status """" Exmh_Focus } proc SelectClear { w } { _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers "

My point was exactly that. For users who run tight, tiny, custom kernels either without initrd (such as myself) or with tiny initrd tailored to a specific hardware config, LILO should be allowed as an option for these users. Grub is bloated because it is designed to accommodate bloat. LILO is the antithesis of bloat. Many OPs don't need or want LILO to be able to accommodate bloated kernel images or initrd. The current version of LILO is fine. We just want the option to be able to use LILO because our kernel images aren't bloated, and Grub is a PITA to work with, and is unnecessary on our systems. -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

ham,"Re: [ILUG] Sun Solaris..On Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 05:13:01PM +0100, Fergal Moran mentioned: > In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX. Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail. Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to other unixen like HPUX and SCO. Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract, they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc. If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc, though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore. You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK, who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux, that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

But that may be an unrelated issue. AFAIK, you should not have any entries in fstab for removable devices that you want to be handled by KDE/Gnome/whatever_other_DE via the dbus/hal mechanism. In any case, I would avoid trying to mix different approaches. > Another (possibly also unrelated) issue is that when several X are > running (different users, all with KDE) then it seems that only one of > them can mount and unmount, usually the wrong user. I have seen that complaint before, also for systems on which mounting worked perfectly for single-user sessions, and I am not sure if a satisfactory solution exists.

Besides, udisks has the same main developer as hal, so I doubt that it will be so radically different that hal know-how will become useless. I have played around a bit with udisks yesterday, it seems to follow the same basic concepts as hal.

There are *many* reasons not to use pdfLaTeX. They do not enter in the scope of this mailing list, but I am pretty sure you will find them directly on the Internet. For example, pdfLaTeX encourages one to use directly JPG, etc., for the inclusion in the document, which is pretty bad. There are also many incompatibilities with different packages. Note that, under Windows, I remember that acrord32.exe always blocked the file for writing, even if it was only being read by acrord32.exe. Okay, it's Windows.

They visited a lot of airshows and covered a lot of miles. I'm sure maintenance (on a 50+ year old airframe), fuel (for two large radial engines) insurance and other costs were out of my price range, but what a hoot! On a more realistic note, the flight to Half Moon bay was probably 2 hours of flight time at about $75/hour in the Cessna. Not exactly a cheap date, but that's nothing compared to the money I've spent on her since. (And loved every minute of it, Darling!!) ""R. A.

If there is a maximum trust value (if trust is some sort of percentage for instance), and if it isn't impossible to reach it, that would prevent too few people to get too much of an avantage. My guess is if 1% of razor users can reach this limit (or be near enough), spammers won't be able to cheat just by building up their trust, they would need a fair amount of fake users too. Now, for the ""fair amount of fake users"", spammers don't have access to many set of network classes. So they would need a bunch of users coming from the same set of ips. If the razor servers see 100 people on a class C network (253 ips) reporting 10000 emails a day, something wrong is going on. This could also trigger alarms. As for legitimate proxies and the like, 1) a proxy should not report any thing (spam should be reported by hand, not automatically), 2) there may be a way to have exception (IBM networks would have lots of users from the same set of ips but no likely spammers, so no alarm would trigger for their network, or better the alarm would be less sensitive). AOL could still give trouble though but even then, for one particular phone line/cable, the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class C (using network subclassing). The spammers could still try to have several connections at different locations, but that increases their cost and so is not so much interesting.

There was a fascinating article in the Economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending, etc. Europe did not show the same increase in fertility. Some actual data for the US are here: http://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdf Part of: http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/profile2000.html - Jim "

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is nobody's problem but Habeas's. A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt. I have yet to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10). If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1, there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their thresholds to 5.

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam, and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g., SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue. There's nobody left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark. Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed. Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops, then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that everybody has to pay them for. The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the privilege of policing their trademark for them. I don't believe they'll ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it. [*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point. ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk "

If you closed your vnc session by *logging out*, what happens is that your session (gnome) is no longer active, but vnc is not concerned. The workaround that was suggested to me is to *not* have vncstartup exec the session, but rather launch a session and cleanup afterwards, ie # wrong #exec gnome-session # right gnome-session vncserver -kill $DISPLAY If you grok the shell you'll probably use the trap command to make sure that cleanup is done no matter what, but that's just a detail good luck -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

They can sit on /your/ copy, but if you start churning out exact dups of a name-brand artifact, people with law degrees start to smell money. For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as (a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the patented bracing methods. If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar on eBay with ""Gibson"" written in crayon on the headstock, and then claim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get upset. M> Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses? To play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away, it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution rights. Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn't stop you from making 10000 copies to sell. M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff. This is the difficult question: How will they draw the distinction? The ""other stuff"" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff. This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents people from doing it? Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with sales or units. The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit should be able to ""own"" someone else's intellectual property. Sarah McLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's the label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been blazingly stupid with her money) But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke. If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems with beautiful-people deadbeat leech ""friends"" draining their riches, think again. The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle, all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different way. Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record. Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits. His fans did the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/ labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills. All Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as something of their own. But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push. Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay before they own what they themselves have created? They pay royalties for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/ favourite song???? That's where the whole system has been seriously warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis. It's not. It's the people who make them; the songs are already theirs. -- Gary Lawrence Murphy TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com ""Computers are useless.

But even without the big charge, earnings at IBM, which sells everything from computer software to microchips to computer services, fell sharply as corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on technology spending.

They go over, find nothing, and go ask Bubba what he was talking about. Bubba tells em it's in JoeBob's woodpile. So they go chop up all the wood and look through it and scatter it all over the yard, but find nothing. They ask Bubba again, and he tells them that JoeBob must have already sold it, so they leave. Bubba calls up JoeBob: Bubba: You get your wood chopped?' JoeBob: Yep, thanks, I'll give ya 15 bucks tomorrow.

His 'thumbs of death' would rival anything a toddler could do to devices. After countless numbers of Walkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion I found the Sony devices. I got him a ""My First Sony"" (be afraid of the marketing) CD player. It was /fire engine red/ but was completely indestructible. I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him. He complained of it's looks but used it nonetheless. I also gave him a pack of headphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't obscenely bulky. Now that we're riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population, how soon before device makers get wise? Not to be morbid, but would the marketing be ""My Last Sony""? -Bill Kearney "

I've just got a few quick thoughts today. First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the outcome. Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, ""Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement."" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on. On to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard, CleverMedia is sponsoring karaoke night at Gnomedex . According to the woman with her finger on the pulse of Gnomedex, Lori Lockwood, ""There is definitely a 'surprise' in the works for the attendees ... "" Hmmm.

Windows Apps in Linux? - Part II I don't want to mince any words, here. CodeWeavers has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released CrossOver Office product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the Wine Project . Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands. Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window. I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete. Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself. For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver. Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more. A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux. Recommend It! Send us a GnomeTWEAK &nbsp;GnomeCORE Kernel Configuration - Part X Today we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration. There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules. See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.

ham,"My Good EasyURL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/07.html#my_good_easy Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00 _Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", ""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus (as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", ""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete ""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them (mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the window. In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My _emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries.

spam,"Awiating your fax response.(Fax) to my direct confidential Fax No: 234 1 7591666 Dr. Kataga Bakori Lagos, Nigeria. 23rd July 2002 Attention President/C.E.O Dear Sir, REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council (N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business. Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual account to receive the funds. The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries. The present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment. However by virtue of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names. I was therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter. the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government financial agencies. We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria (C.B.N). We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor. This we can do by swapping of account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for payment. By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company. This process would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your knowledge when I have heard from you. Thanks for your co-operation, Yours faithfully, Dr. Kataga Bakori NB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to my direct confidential Fax No: 234 1 7591666 --DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam-- ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-Sightings mailing list Spamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings "

Thanks. =46irst you need a (basic) regular expression (BRE) that matches ""\paragrap= h{}"". =20 The '\' is a BRE special character, so it needs to be escaped. Also, the ""= {}""=20 is a bit troublesome with find/-exec, so we will match it using the constru= ct=20 ""[{][}]"". The definitive documentation for regular expression is the Single UNIX=20 Specification, Version 3 -- Base Definitions, Chapter 9. I don't actually= =20 like (man 7 regex) for this. This gives us the regex ""\\paragraph[{][}]"". Now, we need to get that regu= lar=20 expression to sed. (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e ""s/\\paragraph[{][}]= //""=20 {} \;) won't work, since during Quote Removal, one of the '\'s are dropped = and=20 neither find nor sed ""sees"" it. The shell does a *lot* of processing to the text you type before it reaches= =20 the command you are invoking. Single UNIX Specification, Version 3 -- Shel= l=20 and Utilities, Chapter 2 is the core documentation, but some shells are muc= h=20 more featureful. We can either use (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e 's/\\paragraph[{][}]//= '=20 {} \;) OR--my preference--(regex=3D'\\paragraph[{][}]'; find $dir -type f -= exec=20 sed -i -e ""s/$regex//"" {} \;) to make sure sed gets that important '\'. Also, I left it out, but you may want the ""g"" flag to the ""s""ubstitute comm= and=20 in sed. Otherwise, only one occurrence of the regex will get eliminated pe= r=20 line. =2D-=20 Boyd Stephen Smith Jr. 	 ,=3D ,-_-. =3D. bss@iguanasuicide.net 	((_/)o o(\_)) ICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy 	 `-'(. .)`-' http://iguanasuicide.net/ 	 \_/ "

All three of the BSD's packaged IPFilter, which has been around for donkeys years and which has a slightly different feature set to ipfw. However, last year the author of IPFilter (Darren Reed) changed the license on development branches of ipfilter to prohibit redistribution, although official releases would still be kept under the old license. This policy got up the nose of Theo de Raadt (lots of things do, which is why OpenBSD exists in the first place), so OpenBSD re-invented the wheel and called their firewall ""pf"", under a full-time BSD license. The standard release versions of ipfilter are unencumbered, as always. > Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE.

It certainly adds some nice syntactic sugar, and is apparently much faster for certain types of complex rulesets.

It has some nice features like the ability to save and restore state so that connections are persistent across reboots, and its logging is marginally better organised than ipfw's. It's also very mature code, which appeals to the rather conservative tastes of my old age.

Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture, was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law forbidding people from creating a public nuisance. Hamano admits to the allegations. Police said Hamano was riding behind the girl on an escalator at JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted to his presence by the noise emitted by the phone camera's shutter. She turned around to catch Hamano with his hands between her legs. "

ham,"zero brightness post Snow Leopard upgradeOn my white MacBook (2007 eta) that I recently upgraded from Leopard to Snow Leopard. I have installed all current updates. Now, and not before, I notice that frequently when I start to re-use the machine that it has zero brightness when it powers up. The 'increase brightness' control has no effect (but other keys do work). If I close the lid but then reopen it before the machine goes to sleep that usually does the trick and I have medium(ish) brightness and can turn brightness up or down. I am testing if this is related to X11/Xquartz so thought I would ask here if anybody else has experience this problem. I can provide more h/w details later.

Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live there. So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big. (I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand) They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits. Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the worst sort. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Up till this point, I haven't logged in to gnome. But the key is restarting the X server, not necessarily a logout and login to the GNOME desktop. A login/logout sequence is simply the most common way to restart the X server. The X server can only start once safely. After that, who knows what VT it will end up on, and what parts of the old instance of the server will get terminated.

A: If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged to stay with stable. However, there is security support for testing: The Debian testing security team handles issues for testing. They will make sure that the fixed packages enter testing in the usual way by migration from unstable (with reduced quarantine time), or, if that still takes too long, make them available via the the normal http://security.debian.org infrastructure. To use it, make sure the following line is in /etc/apt/sources.list: So yes, testing *does* receive security support Sjoerd "

I see now that it is expected the next stable will ship with 4.4.4. Has there been any word about when 4.4.x will be moved to testing?

Absolutely correct. I wasn't trying to imply the same exact code has been around for 17 years. Hell if that was the case I wouldn't be using it. Whilst the initial Linux porting effort was more than a simple recompile, I don't believe it was a herculanean effort. Far more changes to the XFS code have been made since inclusion in mainline than the changes required to get from IRIX to Linux. I actually saw a brief video interview of one of the SGI IRIX devs quite some time ago in which he described the initial Linux port effort to get it running on SGI's big Origin 3000 MIPS machines. They had to do this to start validating how everything would run under Linux because they didn't have the first Itanium Altix systems manufactured yet. IIRC their testbed was a 32 processor Origin 3000 running MIPS R14K processors. This was back before the Linux MIPS port project existed so they were in essence creating the first Linux MIPS port as part of their effort. He clearly stated that developing/maintaining a Linux MIPS port was not in the cards for SGI, that this effort was strictly a validation effort. He said it took about a week to get Linux booting on the Origin system, and another week to get it stable. The first XFS port to Linux was part of this effort. If it took only 2 weeks for the bulk of this effort, I can't imagine they had to modify a ton of XFS code. IRIX was written in C as is Linux, so the changes in XFS were probably fairly minor. I'd venture to guess that the most significant Linux XFS changes were those for the 32bit X86 code base. IRIX and thus XFS were born on 64bit MIPS RISC CPUs. Moving that to a Linux 64bit Itanium environment was probably relatively straight forward. Moving down to a 32bit platform probably required a lot of code changes, as did the initial Linux 64bit ports up to Alpha, HPPA, Itanium, and eventually MIPS64. -- Stan -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

spam,"Wall Street's dirty little secret ...It was the Spring of 1979. I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids' lunch money. No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said, ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week."" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn't even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead. Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW. According to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is ""NEVER"". In a sense, they are right. If you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. But here's the problem: Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich? Hell no! You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair. If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? Where would you travel? What kind of car would you buy? The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. You want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE. That's how you're going to make the money. What I'm talking about here is day trading. My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars. They make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ... The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, I've learned the following lessons: ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** Anyone can do it. ** It only takes a few hours to learn. When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become wealthy overnight. If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, I had made my first million. The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book, the Master Trader. You will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year. The income of the day trader can be staggering. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes. The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge. I will provide that knowledge, and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you: *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down. *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds. *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make. *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings. *** Make money on the biggest news stories. *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use. *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell? Or am I going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"" Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself? With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars. The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your own financial future. Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market. Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH. Oops, they weren't laughing anymore. In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth. If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game. But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now. I promise to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading. You don't need to know anything about the market, and anyone can do it, with minimum effort. It's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move.

What I am specifically referring to is protesters shouting down speakers or making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That's wrong, immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to get attention is fine. > That picture > will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and > France, at least. For goodness sakes, you're arguing about it on FoRK.

Well, Owen implied the protesters were arrested. Was he just jacking himself off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That attitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what you believe. > It is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on > the nightly > news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly. Sure, just don't whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get in someone's face. One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking out the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC. They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public listen to them on matters of national security? So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if your answr boils down to ""i don't give a shit about what happens to the US"", you can kiss my ass :-) Bill "

Windows Apps in Linux? - Part II I don't want to mince any words, here. CodeWeavers has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released CrossOver Office product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the Wine Project . Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands. Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window. I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete. Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself. For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver. Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more. A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux. Recommend It! Send us a GnomeTWEAK &nbsp;GnomeCORE Kernel Configuration - Part X Today we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration. There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules. See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.

Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good). However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby: http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea. You could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and mount the fat32 partition. Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.

Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem. If untrusted strangers are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or something). Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I would suggest tossing qmail-scanner and SpamAssassin into the mix as well. The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter does its work (including razor-check invocations). Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust. To find out how to do that, go to (which, incidentally, should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for ""qmail newbie's guide to relaying"". - Adrian ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

ham,"How can I initialize a QTMovie object with certain attributes using writable data?Hello all, I'm trying to create an empty QTMovie object that I can add segments to, and then play. This is easy to do with something like: movie = [[QTMovie alloc] initToWritableData:[NSMutableData dataWithCapacity:1048576] error:&error]; I can then use -insertSegmentOfMovie to insert segments from other movies into this one so I can play it back. The problem is that I also need to set a certain attribute when creating the QTMovie object. In particular, I need to set the QTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute attribute, so that I can alter playback speed during playback without changing pitch. This attribute cannot be written after the movie is initialized. So, I can create the QTMovie object like this: movie = [[QTMovie alloc] initWithAttributes:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], QTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute, nil] error:&error]; Unfortunately, this is not editable. I've tried setting the QTMovieEditableAttribute as well on creation, but it does not help. I still get an exception when I try to insert anything into this movie. I presume this is because there is no writable file or data reference associated with the QTMovie. Any ideas on how to solve this?

ham,"[Razor-users] Problem with Razor 2.14 and Spamassassin 2.41This is my first time running Razor, heard a lot of good things about it so I thought I'd give it a shot. I also run SpamAssassin so I'd like to integrate the two. I'm not sure if this problem is with SpamAssassin or Razor, so I though I'd shoot the message here first With a freshly installed SpamAssassin 2.41 and Razor 2.14 I'm seeing these messages spit out from spamd: razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method ""log"" on unblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm line 211, line 75. Any ideas? razor seems to run correctly over the command line.

Hi PT, In regards to Debian, don't let this be a discriminator. If you had a 64-bit and 32-bit system, it would only mean that you'd have to burn two installation CDs. Once those CDs were installed, your installations would be mostly indistinguishable. After the initial install, Debian grabs the right bits for your system. When I switched from 32-bit to 64-bit, the only difference I saw besides a different installation image was a different kernel. -- Bill Wohler aka http://www.newt.com/wohler/ GnuPG ID:610BD9AD -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

ham,"installing Lenny packages in SqueezeIf I were to install a bare-bones Squeeze system, then add Lenny repositories and declare Lenny to be the Default-Release in apt.conf, can I expect to have many problems installing a full desktop environment from the Lenny repos? (Gnome, LXDE, or Fluxbox, most likely). Reason: I use a Debian-Live USB and I like to run Lenny because of the infrequent updates. But one of my laptops requires the Squeeze kernel in order for wifi to work. I've been told by the Debian-Live developer that I cannot install alternate kernels on my live system (otherwise I'd be able to use a kernel from backports.org). -Rob -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".
